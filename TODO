Things still to do:

dismod3/bayesian_models:
  save bayesian models with pymc recommended format
  mcmc convergance diagnostics
  all-cause mortality (also needs model, view, templates, management command)
  condition duration

dismod3/views:
  a way to filter the rates included in an asrf based on a covariate

dismod3/models:
  population - refactor into separate app?  verify that gp interpolation
  is acceptible, or change to linear interpolation (fun bonus points:
  pop pyramid, sex ratio plots)
  all-cause mortality - like an asrf, but maybe special in some ways,
  similar to population in a certain way, as well

dismod3/managements/commands:
  a daemon to fit rates and models when they are created with the ui
  bonus points if it can run remotely --- related to the custom pycode
  approach to covariate analysis

documentation:
  move rate data input spec to this system
  write detailed description of models
  write users guide
