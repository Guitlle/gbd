Introduction
============

This is the currently in-development version of DisMod III, the
Generic Disease Modeling System.  It is being developed for the
Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of
Washington, and will one day be part of the Global Burden of Disease
Study.

This branch of the project contains only the numerical computation
code.
