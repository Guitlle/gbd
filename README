pymc-space-time-regression - a collection of pymc models for imputing
missing values for spatio-temporal health data

models.py contains the following models::

    fe_model - basic fixed effects model
    re_model - basic random effects model
    nested_re_model - random effects model with country random effects nested within region random effects
    nested_gp_re_model - random effects model with gaussian process random effects to borrow strength across time

data.py contains functions for generating synthetic data according to these models
