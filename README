pymc-space-time-regression - a collection of pymc models for imputing
missing values for spatio-temporal health data

models.py contains the following models::

    model.fe - basic fixed effects model
    model.re - basic random effects model
    model.nested_re - random effects model with country random effects nested within region random effects
    model.gp_re - random effects model with gaussian process random effects
    model.nested_gp_re - random effects model with gaussian process random effects nested country-within-region

data.py contains functions for generating synthetic data according to these models

graphics.py contains functions for visualizing the results
