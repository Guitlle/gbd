\section{Modeling diseases with mostly prevalence data}

A surprising headline of the first GBD study was the unexpectedly
large burden of mental disorders like depression and
schizophrenia. The epidemiology of these conditions, as well as many
other mental and neurological disorders, are known primarily from
prevalence studies. This chapter considers in detail the setting where
prevalence data is the primary source of input data.

TK A lot of prevalence, expert priors on everything else

TK Prevalence plus a few data points on other things

TK Prevalence data which clearly violates time equilibrium assumption

TK Birth prevalence data only â€“ no need for fancy statistical model
