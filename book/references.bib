Abstract = {{Regression spline smoothing involves modelling a regression function as
   a piecewise polynomial with a high number of pieces relative to the
   sample size. Because the number of possible models is so large,
   efficient strategies for choosing among them are required. In this paper
   we review approaches to this problem and compare them through a
   simulation study. For simplicity and conciseness we restrict attention
   to the univariate smoothing setting with Gaussian noise and the
   truncated polynomial regression spline basis.}},
