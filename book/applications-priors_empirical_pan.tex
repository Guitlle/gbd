\label{applications-priors_empirical}

Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas, most commonly caused by alcohol or gallstones.  In most cases, the disease resolves itself and there is no need for treatment.  However, some acute cases develop pancreatic necrosis and systemic organ failure.  These complications require immediate treatment and have a high mortality risk. \cite{raraty_acute_2004, banks_epidemiology_2002, sekimoto_JPN_2006}
