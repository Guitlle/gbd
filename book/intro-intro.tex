This book, \emph{Integrated Meta-regression Framework for Descriptive
  Epidemiology} is a full-length treatment of new meta-analytic
methods for descriptive epidemiology.  From first principles, it
develops the integrative systems model which constitutes the
theoretical foundation of years lived with disability (YLD) estimation
in burden of disease studies like the Global Burden of Disease 2010
Study (GBD 2010 Study).  The estimation approach relies on producing
age-specific prevalence estimates of the non-fatal outcomes of a vast
array of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.  As part of the GBD
2010 Study, we have developed a Bayesian meta-regression tool
specifically for this purpose. This tool estimates a generalized
negative binomial model for all the epidemiological data with various
types of fixed and random effects.  These include age fixed effects,
fixed effects for covariates that predict country variation in the
quantity of interest, fixed effects that predict variation across
studies due to attributes of the study protocol, and super region,
region and country random intercepts.  The tool uses Bayesian
inference of the parameters to sample from the joint posterior
distribution of model, incorporating all relevant descriptive
epidemiological data.  This approach is new, but the line of research
builds on work in generic disease modeling that has been in use for
almost 20 years in global health
epidemiology.\cite{Barendregt_Generic_2003} However, until now, the
description of the models and the methods have been scattered through
the scientific literature in a loose collection of journal articles,
burden of disease reports, and operations manuals.

This book substantially extends the previous modeling efforts for YLD estimation
in Burden of Disease estimation, by formally connecting a system dynamics model of disease
progression to a statistical model of epidemiological rates, the kind
that are calculated in descriptive epidemiological research and
collected together in a systematic review.  This combination of
systems dynamics modeling and statistical modeling, which I call
\emph{integrative systems modeling} allows the model to integrate all
available relevant data.  Because of the advanced numerical algorithms needed to fit these complex models, a section of the book provides the
necessary background on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and other
relevant computational methods.

Experience with the results of systematic review indicates that when
all available relevant data are collected, they are often very
\emph{sparse} and very \emph{noisy}.  In GBD estimation, data sparsity
often means that there are whole regions of the globe for which no
data is available.  Sparse data mean that predictions of prevalence
need to take advantage of relationships to covariates in the
meta-regression or default to the average of a region, super-region or
the world.  Noisy data is an additional challenge. In the regions or
countries with multiple measurements, the results are often highly
heterogeneous. The degree of heterogeneity is far beyond what is
expected on the basis of sampling error and indicates considerable
non-sampling variance.  The sources of non-sampling variance include
sample design, implementation issues in data collection, case
definitions, and diagnostic technologies.

There are a number of other common challenges in estimating the
prevalence of non-fatal outcomes of disease, which are also addressed
in the new framework.
\begin{itemize}
\item Published studies often use non-standard age-groups like 18-35
or 15 and above.  For the GBD, we need to use data from many different
non-standard age-groups to generate coherent estimates for the 20
age-groups for the study.  Given that prevalence for most sequelae are
strongly related to age, this issue is particularly important.

\item Data for conditions are collected for many different outcomes
such as incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality or
cause-specific mortality.  The mix of data varies across diseases and
across regions for a disease.  All of these sources provide some
relevant information for estimating prevalence but more often than not
are not strictly comparable due to variations in case definition or
other methodological differences.

\item Within regions or
countries, the true prevalence for a sequela can vary enormously. The
high level of hepatitis C in Egypt is an example in the Middle-East
and North Africa region.  Such within-region heterogeneity in the true
rates must be accommodated in a meta-regression framework.

\item Based on biology, exposure or clinical series, we may have strong
priors on the age pattern of incidence or prevalence for a condition;
for example, we expect the incidence of many cancers to increase with
age due to cumulative exposure to carcinogens at least until some
adult age.  Other examples include no bipolar disorder at very young
ages.  

\item For many conditions the available studies use
different case definitions.  The review of diabetes prevalence studies
identified 18 different case definitions in use.  If all non-reference
definition data are excluded, predictions can be based on an extremely
limited number of studies only.  An alternative is to empirically
adjust (“cross-walk”) between different definitions using the overlap
in available studies.
\end{itemize}

The statistical model developed in this book focuses
particularly on techniques for handling sparse, noisy data, as well as
addressing these additional challenges.  The book explores statistical
models for overdispersed count data, covariate modeling to explain
systematic variation in epidemiological data and increase predictive
accuracy for estimates where no data are available, and age-pattern
modeling to systematically incorporate expert knowledge about how
epidemiological rates vary as a function of age.  It also develops a
novel theory of age-group modeling to address heterogeneity in age
groups commonly found during systematic review.

The theoretical foundations of integrative systems modeling of disease
in populations consititute the first half of this book.  The second
half of the book contains a series of applications of the model to the
meta-analysis of more than a dozen different diseases.  These
practical applications demonstrate how the model performs in a variety
of scenarios. They also investigate how the model performs when the
model assumptions are violated.
