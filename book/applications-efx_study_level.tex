Fixed effects explain the bias and variation of noisy measurements in terms of demographic, epidemiologic and study-specific variables.  Unlike random effects that vary by geographic unit, fixed effects have covariates that differ by study or country-year.  Frequently in meta-analysis of psychological disorders, such as anxiety, studies use different recall periods in the measurement of epidemiologic rates.  In this case, fixed effect study-level covariates explain the bias of the measurements resulting from different recall periods.

Anxiety disorders encompass several conditions characterized by prominent anxiety at a level which interferes with daily life.  Not all anxiety disorders manifest in similar ways.  While generalized anxiety disorder is typically marked by persistent worry, panic disorder is usually characterized by intense fear for discrete periods of time \cite{american_diagnostic_2000}.

Anxiety disorders do not have a consistent recall period for the measurement of epidemiological rates.  Therefore the data from meta-analysis has studies with measurements of point prevalence and period prevalence (i.e. 6-month or past year prevalence).  Due to the high remission rate for anxiety disorders, period prevalence is typically higher than point prevalence as seen in figure \ref{fig:app-anxiety data}.

Excluding period prevalence measurements reduces the quantity of data and produces results that are generally much lower than estimates using all of the data without fixed effects.  Using a fixed effect study-level covariate to explain the systematic bias and variation resulting from different recall periods lowers the prevalence estimate as seen in figure \ref{fig:app-anxiety FE}.
