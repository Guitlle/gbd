	abstract = {Despite having achieved an average life expectancy of 75 years, much the same as that of more developed countries, Mexico entered the 21st century with a health system mared by its failure to offer financial protection in health to more than half of its citizens; this was both a result and a cause of the social inequalities that have marked the development process in Mexico. Several structural limitations have hampered performance and limited the progress of the health system. Conscious that the lack of financial protection was the major bottleneck, Mexico has embarked on a structural reform to improve health system performance by establishing the System of Social Protection in Health {(SSPH)}, which has introduced new financial rules and incentives. The main innovation of the reform has been the Seguro Popular {(Popular} Health Insurance), the insurance-based component of the {SSPH}, aimed at funding health care for all those families, most of them poor, who had been previously excluded from social health insurance. The reform has allowed for a substantial increase in public investment in health while realigning incentives towards better technical and interpersonal quality. This paper describes the main features and initial results of the Mexican reform effort, and derives lessons for other countries considering health-system transformations under similarly challenging circumstances.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is known to be associated with overall mortality. We investigated the effects of age, race, sex, smoking status, and history of disease on the relation between body-mass index and mortality.


{METHODS}

In a prospective study of more than 1 million adults in the United States (457,785 men and 588,369 women), 201,622 deaths occurred during 14 years of follow-up. We examined the relation between body-mass index and the risk of death from all causes in four subgroups categorized according to smoking status and history of disease. In healthy people who had never smoked, we further examined whether the relation varied according to race, cause of death, or age. The relative risk was used to assess the relation between mortality and body-mass index.


{RESULTS}

The association between body-mass index and the risk of death was substantially modified by smoking status and the presence of disease. In healthy people who had never smoked, the nadir of the curve for body-mass index and mortality was found at a body-mass index of 23.5 to 24.9 in men and 22.0 to 23.4 in women. Among subjects with the highest body-mass indexes, white men and women had a relative risk of death of 2.58 and 2.00, respectively, as compared with those with a body-mass index of 23.5 to 24.9. Black men and women with the highest body-mass indexes had much lower risks of death (1.35 and 1.21), which did not differ significantly from 1.00. A high body-mass index was most predictive of death from cardiovascular disease, especially in men (relative risk, 2.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.37 to 3.56). Heavier men and women in all age groups had an increased risk of death.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other diseases increases throughout the range of moderate and severe overweight for both men and women in all age groups. The risk associated with a high body-mass index is greater for whites than for blacks.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} There has been increasing interest in measuring under-five mortality as a health indicator and as a critical measure of human development. In countries with complete vital registration systems that capture all births and deaths, under-five mortality can be directly calculated. In the absence of a complete vital registration system, however, child mortality must be estimated using surveys that ask women to report the births and deaths of their children. Two survey methods exist for capturing this information: summary birth histories and complete birth histories. A summary birth history requires a minimum of only two questions: how many live births has each mother had and how many of them have survived. Indirect methods are then applied using the information from these two questions and the age of the mother to estimate under-five mortality going back in time prior to the survey. Estimates generated from complete birth histories are viewed as the most accurate when surveys are required to estimate under-five mortality, especially for the most recent time periods. However, it is much more costly and labor intensive to collect these detailed data, especially for the purpose of generating small area estimates. As a result, there is a demand for improvement of the methods employing summary birth history data to produce more accurate as well as subnational estimates of child mortality. {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS:} We used data from 166 Demographic and Health Surveys {(DHS)} to develop new empirically based methods of estimating under-five mortality using children ever born and children dead data. We then validated them using both in- and out-of-sample analyses. We developed a range of methods on the basis of three dimensions of the problem: (1) approximating the average length of exposure to mortality from a mother's set of children using either maternal age or time since first birth; (2) using cohort and period measures of the fraction of children ever born that are dead; and (3) capturing country and regional variation in the age pattern of fertility and mortality. We focused on improving estimates in the most recent time periods prior to a survey where the traditional indirect methods fail. In addition, all of our methods incorporated uncertainty. Validated against under-five estimates generated from complete birth histories, our methods outperformed the standard indirect method by an average of 43.7\% (95\% confidence interval {[CI]} 41.2-45.2). In the 5 y prior to the survey, the new methods resulted in a 53.3\% (95\% {CI} 51.3-55.2) improvement. To illustrate the value of this method for local area estimation, we applied our new methods to an analysis of summary birth histories in the 1990, 2000, and 2005 Mexican censuses, generating subnational estimates of under-five mortality for each of 233 jurisdictions. {CONCLUSIONS:} The new methods significantly improve the estimation of under-five mortality using summary birth history data. In areas without vital registration data, summary birth histories can provide accurate estimates of child mortality. Because only two questions are required of a female respondent to generate these data, they can easily be included in existing survey programs as well as routine censuses of the population. With the wider application of these methods to census data, countries now have the means to generate estimates for subnational areas and population subgroups, important for measuring and addressing health inequalities and developing local policy to improve child survival.

	abstract = {Background: Clinical and population studies have shown that exposure and sensitization to allergens derived from furred pets, particularly cats, represent an important risk factor of allergic respiratory disease and also a significant risk factor for asthma. Objective: In the framework of the multicenter European Community Respiratory Health Survey an analysis of the association of current and childhood exposure to cat with atopic sensitization to cat was conducted. Methods: This study included cross-sectional data from 35 centers representing 16 countries. Altogether, 18,097 subjects were included, of whom 13,509 (75\%) provided a blood sample for the measurement of specific {IgE.} Exposure data and data for potential confounders were extracted from an interviewer-led questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of sensitization to cat (serum specific {IgE} \&gt;0.35 {kU/L)} was 9\%. Among those who did not report allergic symptoms in the presence of pets or house dust, those who owned cats were significantly more likely to be sensitized to cats than were those who did not (odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] 1.57 [1.20-2.06]. Childhood exposure to pets including cats was associated with lower sensitization to cats in adulthood, particularly among those with a positive family history of atopy (odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] 0.68 [0.51-0.93]. Positive correlations were found between the community prevalence of cat and the prevalences of sensitization to cat, respiratory symptoms, physician-diagnosed asthma, and current asthma medication. Conclusions: Current cat ownership represents a significant risk for sensitization to cat if cats are allowed indoors. Our results support the hypothesis that childhood exposure to pets, including cats, might modulate immunologic mechanisms and reduce sensitization to cat in adulthood. The significant correlation found between the community prevalence of cat ownership and community prevalence of specific sensitization to cat represents the first documentation of such a relationship. {(J} Allergy Clin Immunol 1999;104:941-7.)},

Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease {(CHD)}, death from {CHD}, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.

The gene encoding a foreign major histocompatibility complex protein, {HLA-B7}, was introduced into {HLA-B7-negative} patients with advanced melanoma by injection of {DNA-liposome} complexes in an effort to demonstrate gene transfer, document recombinant gene expression, and determine the safety and potential toxicity of this therapy. Six courses of treatment were completed without complications in five {HLA-B7-negative} patients with stage {IV} melanoma. Plasmid {DNA} was detected within biopsies of treated tumor nodules 3-7 days after injection but was not found in the serum at any time by using the polymerase chain reaction. Recombinant {HLA-B7} protein was demonstrated in tumor biopsy tissue in all five patients by immunochemistry, and immune responses to {HLA-B7} and autologous tumors could be detected. No antibodies to {DNA} were detected in any patient. One patient demonstrated regression of injected nodules on two independent treatments, which was accompanied by regression at distant sites.

	abstract = {Summary
Health statistics are at the centre of an increasing number of worldwide health controversies. Several factors are sharpening the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals {(MDGs)} provide a high-profile example. With thousands of indicators recommended but few measured well, the worldwide health community needs to focus its efforts on improving measurement of a small set of priority areas. Priority indicators should be selected on the basis of public-health significance and several dimensions of measurability. Health statistics can be divided into three types: crude, corrected, and predicted. Health statistics are necessary inputs to planning and strategic decision making, programme implementation, monitoring progress towards targets, and assessment of what works and what does not. Crude statistics that are biased have no role in any of these steps; corrected statistics are preferred. For strategic decision making, when corrected statistics are unavailable, predicted statistics can play an important part. For monitoring progress towards agreed targets and assessment of what works and what does not, however, predicted statistics should not be used. Perhaps the most effective method to decrease controversy over health statistics and to encourage better primary data collection and the development of better analytical methods is a strong commitment to provision of an explicit data audit trail. This initiative would make available the primary data, all post-data collection adjustments, models including covariates used for farcasting and forecasting, and necessary documentation to the public.},

Effective interventions exist for many priority health problems in low income countries; prices are falling, and funds are increasing. However, progress towards agreed health goals remains slow. There is increasing consensus that stronger health systems are key to achieving improved health outcomes. There is much less agreement on quite how to strengthen them. Part of the challenge is to get existing and emerging knowledge about more (and less) effective strategies into practice. The evidence base also remains remarkably weak, partly because health-systems research has an image problem. The forthcoming Ministerial Summit on Health Research seeks to help define a learning agenda for health systems, so that by 2015, substantial progress will have been made to reducing the system constraints to achieving the {MDGs.}},

Fish (finfish or shellfish) may have health benefits and also contain contaminants, resulting in confusion over the role of fish consumption in a healthy diet.


{EVIDENCE} {ACQUISITION}

We searched {MEDLINE}, governmental reports, and meta-analyses, supplemented by hand reviews of references and direct investigator contacts, to identify reports published through April 2006 evaluating (1) intake of fish or fish oil and cardiovascular risk, (2) effects of methylmercury and fish oil on early neurodevelopment, (3) risks of methylmercury for cardiovascular and neurologic outcomes in adults, and (4) health risks of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in fish. We concentrated on studies evaluating risk in humans, focusing on evidence, when available, from randomized trials and large prospective studies. When possible, meta-analyses were performed to characterize benefits and risks most precisely.


{EVIDENCE} {SYNTHESIS}

Modest consumption of fish (eg, 1-2 servings/wk), especially species higher in the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid {(EPA)} and docosahexaenoic acid {(DHA)}, reduces risk of coronary death by 36\% (95\% confidence interval, 20\%-50\%; P{\textless}.001) and total mortality by 17\% (95\% confidence interval, 0\%-32\%; P = .046) and may favorably affect other clinical outcomes. Intake of 250 mg/d of {EPA} and {DHA} appears sufficient for primary prevention. {DHA} appears beneficial for, and low-level methylmercury may adversely affect, early neurodevelopment. Women of childbearing age and nursing mothers should consume 2 seafood servings/wk, limiting intake of selected species. Health effects of low-level methylmercury in adults are not clearly established; methylmercury may modestly decrease the cardiovascular benefits of fish intake. A variety of seafood should be consumed; individuals with very high consumption ({\textgreater} or =5 servings/wk) should limit intake of species highest in mercury levels. Levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in fish are low, and potential carcinogenic and other effects are outweighed by potential benefits of fish intake and should have little impact on choices or consumption of seafood (women of childbearing age should consult regional advisories for locally caught freshwater fish).


{CONCLUSIONS}

For major health outcomes among adults, based on both the strength of the evidence and the potential magnitudes of effect, the benefits of fish intake exceed the potential risks. For women of childbearing age, benefits of modest fish intake, excepting a few selected species, also outweigh risks.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To estimate parameters of the function relating alcohol consumption with the risk of coronary heart disease and to identify the sources of heterogeneity in the parameter estimates.


{METHODS}

A search of the epidemiological literature from 1966 to 1998 was performed using several bibliographic databases. Meta-regression models were fitted to evaluate non-linear effects of alcohol intake on the relative risk. The effects of some characteristics of the studies, including an index of their quality, were considered as putative sources of heterogeneity of the estimates. Publication bias was also investigated.


{FINDINGS}

Among the 196 initially reviewed articles, 51 were selected. Since qualitative characteristics of the studies were significant sources of heterogeneity, the pooled dose-response functions were based on the 28 cohort studies with higher quality. Risk decreased from 0 to 20 g/day {(RR} = 0.80; 95\% {CI:} 0.78, 0.83); there was evidence of a protective effect up to 72 g/day {(RR} = 0.96; 95\% {CI:} 0.92, 1.00) and increased risk above {\textgreater} or = 89 g/day {(RR} = 1.05; 95\% {CI:} 1.00, 1.11). Lower protective effects and harmful effects were found in women, in men living in countries outside the Mediterranean area and in studies where fatal events were used as the outcome. Evidence of publication bias for moderate intakes and of heterogeneity of the estimates across studies for higher intakes were found.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The degree of protection from moderate doses of alcohol should be reconsidered. Further research investigating the effect of drinking patterns on the risk of coronary heart disease should be performed. Caution in making general recommendations is needed.},

	abstract = {Summary
Alcoholic beverages, and the problems they engender, have been familiar fixtures in human societies since the beginning of recorded history. We review advances in alcohol science in terms of three topics: the epidemiology of alcohol's role in health and illness; the treatment of alcohol use disorders in a public health perspective; and policy research and options. Research has contributed substantially to our understanding of the relation of drinking to specific disorders, and has shown that the relation between alcohol consumption and health outcomes is complex and multidimensional. Alcohol is causally related to more than 60 different medical conditions. Overall, 4\% of the global burden of disease is attributable to alcohol, which accounts for about as much death and disability globally as tobacco and hypertension. Treatment research shows that early intervention in primary care is feasible and effective, and a variety of behavioural and pharmacological interventions are available to treat alcohol dependence. This evidence suggests that treatment of alcohol-related problems should be incorporated into a public health response to alcohol problems. Additionally, evidence-based preventive measures are available at both the individual and population levels, with alcohol taxes, restrictions on alcohol availability, and drinking-driving countermeasures among the most effective policy options. Despite the scientific advances, alcohol problems continue to present a major challenge to medicine and public health, in part because population-based public health approaches have been neglected in favour of approaches oriented to the individual that tend to be more palliative than preventative.},

Maternal mortality remains a major challenge to health systems worldwide. Reliable information about the rates and trends in maternal mortality is essential for resource mobilisation, and for planning and assessment of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 {(MDG} 5), the target for which is a 75\% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio {(MMR)} from 1990 to 2015. We assessed levels and trends in maternal mortality for 181 {countries.Methods}
We constructed a database of 2651 observations of maternal mortality for 181 countries for 1980-2008, from vital registration data, censuses, surveys, and verbal autopsy studies. We used robust analytical methods to generate estimates of maternal deaths and the {MMR} for each year between 1980 and 2008. We explored the sensitivity of our data to model specification and show the out-of-sample predictive validity of our {methods.Findings}
We estimated that there were 342[punctuation space]900 (uncertainty interval 302[punctuation space]100-394[punctuation space]300) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008, down from 526[punctuation space]300 (446[punctuation space]400-629[punctuation space]600) in 1980. The global {MMR} decreased from 422 (358-505) in 1980 to 320 (272-388) in 1990, and was 251 (221-289) per 100[punctuation space]000 livebirths in 2008. The yearly rate of decline of the global {MMR} since 1990 was 1·3\% (1·0-1·5). During 1990-2008, rates of yearly decline in the {MMR} varied between countries, from 8·8\% (8·7-14·1) in the Maldives to an increase of 5·5\% (5·2-5·6) in Zimbabwe. More than 50\% of all maternal deaths were in only six countries in 2008 {(India}, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In the absence of {HIV}, there would have been 281[punctuation space]500 (243[punctuation space]900-327[punctuation space]900) maternal deaths worldwide in {2008.Interpretation}
Substantial, albeit varied, progress has been made towards {MDG} 5. Although only 23 countries are on track to achieve a 75\% decrease in {MMR} by 2015, countries such as Egypt, China, Ecuador, and Bolivia have been achieving accelerated {progress.Funding}

	abstract = {Objectives During the past decades a widening of the relative gap in death rates between upper and lower socioeconomic groups has been reported for several European countries. Although differential mortality decline for cardiovascular diseases has been suggested as an important contributory factor, it is not known what its quantitative contribution was, and to what extent other causes of death have contributed to the widening gap in total {mortality.Methods} We collected data on mortality by educational level and occupational class among men and women from national longitudinal studies in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, {England/Wales}, and Italy {(Turin)}, and analysed age-standardized death rates in two recent time periods (1981–1985 and 1991–1995), both total mortality and by cause of death. For simplicity, we report on inequalities in mortality between two broad socioeconomic groups (high and low educational level, non-manual and manual {occupations).Results} Relative inequalities in total mortality have increased in all six countries, but absolute differences in total mortality were fairly stable, with the exception of Finland where an increase occurred. In most countries, mortality from cardiovascular diseases declined proportionally faster in the upper socioeconomic groups. The exception is Italy {(Turin)} where the reverse occurred. In all countries with the exception of Italy {(Turin)}, changes in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed about half of the widening relative gap for total mortality. Other causes also made important contributions to the widening gap in total mortality. For these causes, widening inequalities were sometimes due to increasing mortality rates in the lower socioeconomic groups. We found rising rates of mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, and injuries among men and/or women in lower socioeconomic groups in several {countries.Conclusions} Reducing socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in Western Europe critically depends upon speeding up mortality declines from cardiovascular diseases in lower socioeconomic groups, and countering mortality increases from several other causes of death in lower socioeconomic groups.},

The aim of this study was to describe and compare the characteristics of severe critically ill and non-severe pregnant women with 2009 {A/H1N1v-related} illness in France. {METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS} A national registry was created to screen pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed 2009 {A/H1N1v} influenza. Three hundred and fifteen patients from 46 French hospitals were included: 40 patients were admitted to intensive care units (severe outcomes), 111 were hospitalized in obstetric or medical wards (moderate outcomes), and 164 were outpatients (mild outcomes). The 2009 {A/H1N1v} influenza illness occurred during all pregnancy trimesters, but most women (54\%), notably the severe patients (70\%), were in the third trimester. Among the severe patients, twenty (50\%) underwent mechanical ventilation, and eleven (28\%) were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Three women died from {A/H1N1v} influenza. We found a strong association between the development of a severe outcome and both co-existing illnesses (adjusted odds ratio {[OR]}, 5.1; 95\% confidence interval {[CI]}, 2.2-11.8) and a delay in oseltamivir treatment after the onset of symptoms ({\textgreater}3 or 5 days) (adjusted {OR}, 4.8; 95\% {CI}, 1.9-12.1 and 61.2, 95\% {CI;} 14.4-261.3, respectively).

None of these neonates developed 2009 {A/H1N1v} infection. {CONCLUSIONS} This series confirms the high incidence of complications in pregnant women infected with pandemic {A/H1N1v} observed in other countries but depicts a lower overall maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity than indicated in the {USA} or Australia.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {METHODS}

To estimate the magnitude of the human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)} epidemic among university students, we conducted a blinded {HIV-seroprevalence} survey at 19 universities throughout the United States. {HIV-antibody} testing was performed on blood collected for routine medical purposes at the student health centers of the participating institutions. At each campus, from 250 to 1000 blood specimens were collected consecutively and tested for {HIV} antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. Nonidentifying demographic data were linked with the test results.


{RESULTS}

Of 16,863 specimens in the sample, 30 (0.2 percent) were positive for antibodies to {HIV.} Positive specimens were found at 9 of the 19 schools. All were from students over 18 years old; 19 (63 percent) were from students over 24. All but 2 of the 30 infected students were men. The seroprevalence rate for men was 0.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.7), and for women it was 0.02 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.066). Seroprevalence increased with age--from 0.08 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.15) for students 18 to 24 years old to 1.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 2.9) for those 40 or older.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{HIV} infection is present on {U.S.} university campuses, although the rate appears to be far lower than that of populations known to be at high risk. The potential clearly exists, however, for the further spread of {HIV} infection in this population, and preventive measures are needed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The influence of excess body weight on the risk of death from cancer has not been fully characterized.


{METHODS}

In a prospectively studied population of more than 900,000 {U.S.} adults (404,576 men and 495,477 women) who were free of cancer at enrollment in 1982, there were 57,145 deaths from cancer during 16 years of follow-up. We examined the relation in men and women between the body-mass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers and from cancers at individual sites, while controlling for other risk factors in multivariate proportional-hazards models. We calculated the proportion of all deaths from cancer that was attributable to overweight and obesity in the {U.S.} population on the basis of risk estimates from the current study and national estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the {U.S.} adult population.


{RESULTS}

The heaviest members of this cohort (those with a body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] of at least 40) had death rates from all cancers combined that were 52 percent higher (for men) and 62 percent higher (for women) than the rates in men and women of normal weight. For men, the relative risk of death was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05); for women, the relative risk was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to 1.87). In both men and women, body-mass index was also significantly associated with higher rates of death due to cancer of the esophagus, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidney; the same was true for death due to {non-Hodgkin's} lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Significant trends of increasing risk with higher body-mass-index values were observed for death from cancers of the stomach and prostate in men and for death from cancers of the breast, uterus, cervix, and ovary in women. On the basis of associations observed in this study, we estimate that current patterns of overweight and obesity in the United States could account for 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of those in women.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Increased body weight was associated with increased death rates for all cancers combined and for cancers at multiple specific sites.},

This transition to parasitism can be modeled in vitro by stimulating infective larvae with a low molecular weight ultrafiltrate of host serum together with methylated glutathione analogues. When stimulated to resume development in vitro, activated larvae of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum released a {42-kDa} protein, termed Ancylostoma-secreted protein {(ASP).} {ASP} was the major protein released by activated hookworm larvae. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, based on a partial internal amino acid sequence of the protein, were used together with flanking vector sequence primers to amplify a fragment from a third stage larval {cDNA} library by polymerase chain reaction. The fragment was used as a probe to isolate a longer clone from the larval {cDNA} library. The full-length {ASP} {cDNA} was found to encode a 424-amino acid protein with homology to the antigen 5/antigen 3 family of proteins from hymenopteran venoms and a family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins. {ASP} was expressed in bacterial cells, and a polyclonal antiserum against purified recombinant {ASP} was produced. The antiserum, which was demonstrated to be specific for {ASP}, was used as a probe to measure the kinetics of {ASP} release by hookworm larvae. {ASP} is released within 30 min of stimulation, with the majority released by 4 h. Low levels of {ASP} were released continuously following activation, but only if the stimuli were present in the incubation medium. The compound 4,7-phenanthroline, previously shown to inhibit larval activation, also inhibited release of {ASP.} The specific, rapid release of {ASP} by activated infective larvae suggests that this molecule occupies a critical and central role in the transition from the external environment to parasitism.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Case management {(CM)} is a systematic approach to supplement physician-centered efforts to prevent cardiovascular disease {(CVD).} Research is limited on its implementation and efficacy in low-income, ethnic minority populations.


{METHODS}

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate a nurse- and dietitian-led {CM} program for reducing major {CVD} risk factors in low-income, primarily ethnic minority patients in a county health care system, 63.0\% of whom had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome was the Framingham risk score {(FRS).}


{RESULTS}

A total of 419 patients at elevated risk of {CVD} events were randomized and followed up for a mean of 16 months (81.4\% retention). The mean {FRS} was significantly lower for the {CM} vs usual care group at follow-up (7.80 [95\% confidence interval, 7.21-8.38] vs 8.93 [8.36-9.49]; P = .001) after adjusting for baseline {FRS.} This is equivalent to 5 fewer heart disease events per 1000 individuals per year attributable to the intervention or to 200 individuals receiving the intervention to prevent 1 event per year. The pattern of group differences in the {FRS} was similar in subgroups defined a priori by sex and ethnicity. The main driver of these differences was lowering the mean {(SD)} systolic (-4.2 [18.5] vs 2.6 [22.7] mm Hg; P = .003) and diastolic (-6.0 [11.6] vs -3.0 [11.7] mm Hg; P = .02) blood pressures for the {CM} vs usual care group.


{CONCLUSION}

Nurse and dietitian {CM} targeting multifactor risk reduction can lead to modest improvements in {CVD} risk factors among high-risk patients in low-income, ethnic minority populations receiving care in county health clinics.

The purpose of this study was to assess the strength of this association in a meta-analysis. Cohort studies were selected if they reported relative risks {(RRs)} and 95\% {CI} for coronary heart disease or mortality and if they presented a quantitative assessment of fruit and vegetable intake. The pooled {RRs} were calculated for each additional portion of fruit and/or vegetables consumed per day, and the linearity of the associations were examined. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis that consisted of 91,379 men, 129,701 women, and 5,007 {CHD} events. The risk of {CHD} was decreased by 4\% {[RR} (95\% {CI):} 0.96 (0.93–0.99), P = 0.0027] for each additional portion per day of fruit and vegetable intake and by 7\% [0.93 (0.89–0.96), P {\textless} 0.0001] for fruit intake. The association between vegetable intake and {CHD} risk was heterogeneous {(P} = 0.0043), more marked for cardiovascular mortality [0.74 (0.75–0.84), P {\textless} 0.0001] than for fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction [0.95 (0.92–0.99), P = 0.0058]. Visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested a publication bias, although not statistically significant. Therefore, the reported {RRs} are probably overestimated. This meta-analysis of cohort studies shows that fruit and vegetable consumption is inversely associated with the risk of {CHD.} The causal mechanism of this association, however, remains to be demonstrated.},

Maternal and child undernutrition is highly prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, resulting in substantial increases in mortality and overall disease burden. In this paper, we present new analyses to estimate the effects of the risks related to measures of undernutrition, as well as to suboptimum breastfeeding practices on mortality and disease. We estimated that stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth restriction together were responsible for 2·2 million deaths and 21\% of disability-adjusted life-years {(DALYs)} for children younger than 5 years. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 0·6 million and 0·4 million deaths, respectively, and a combined 9\% of global childhood {DALYs.} Iron and iodine deficiencies resulted in few child deaths, and combined were responsible for about 0·2\% of global childhood {DALYs.} Iron deficiency as a risk factor for maternal mortality added 115 000 deaths and 0·4\% of global total {DALYs.} Suboptimum breastfeeding was estimated to be responsible for 1·4 million child deaths and 44 million {DALYs} (10\% of {DALYs} in children younger than 5 years). In an analysis that accounted for co-exposure of these nutrition-related factors, they were together responsible for about 35\% of child deaths and 11\% of the total global disease burden. The high mortality and disease burden resulting from these nutrition-related factors make a compelling case for the urgent implementation of interventions to reduce their occurrence or ameliorate their consequences.},

Heroin-assisted substitution treatment for severely opioid-dependent drug users has been available in Switzerland since 1994. Our aim was to ascertain the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this treatment.
Methods
We did a cohort study in 21 community outpatient treatment centres. We assessed 1969 opioid-dependent drug users, who began heroin-assisted substitution treatment between January, 1994, and December, 2000, to ascertain admission and discharge patterns, and patient characteristics. We also followed up a subset of 237 patients who began treatment between Jan 1, 1994, and March 31, 1995, and who stayed with the programme for at least 18 months. We used questionnaires, interviews, and medical examinations done at entry and after 6, 12, and 18 months to assess somatic and mental health, social integration, and treatment outcomes.
Findings
More than 70\% (1378) of patients remained in treatment for more than a year. Treatment showed positive effects with respect to health and social outcomes. A long stay in treatment was related to a higher chance of starting abstinence-oriented therapy than a short stay.
Interpretation
Heroin-assisted substitution treatment might be an effective option for chronically addicted patients for whom other treatments have failed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we review the available summary measures for the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in health. Measures which have been used differ in a number of important respects, including (1) the measurement of “relative” or “absolute” differences; (2) the measurement of an “effect” of lower socio-economic status, or of the “total impact” of socio-economic inequalities in-health upon the health status of the population; (3) simple versus sophisticated measurement techniques. Based on this analysis of summary measures which have previously been applied, eight different classes of summary measures can be distinguished. Because measures of “total impact” can be further subdivided on the basis of their underlying assumptions, we finally arrive at 12 types of summary measure. Each of these has its merits, and choice of a particular type of summary measure will depend partly on technical considerations, partly on one's perspective on socio-economic inequalities in health. In practice, it will often be useful to compare the results of several summary measures. These principles are illustrated with two examples: one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in mortality by occupational class in Finland, and one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in self-reported morbidity by level of education in the Netherlands.},

However, epidemiological evidence to implicate antioxidant vitamins is weak, and data on the role of flavonoid-rich foods and antioxidant trace elements are lacking. We carried out a population-based case-control study in South London, {UK}, to investigate whether asthma is less common and less severe in adults who consume more dietary antioxidants. Participants were aged 16-50 yr and registered with 40 general practices. Asthma was defined by positive responses to a standard screening questionnaire in 1996, and complete information about usual diet was obtained by food frequency questionnaire from 607 cases and 864 controls in 1997. After controlling for potential confounding factors and total energy intake, apple consumption was negatively associated with asthma (odds ratio {[OR]} per increase in frequency group 0.89 [95\% confidence interval {[CI]:} 0.82 to 0.97]; p = 0.006). Intake of selenium was also negatively associated with asthma {(OR} per quintile increase 0.84 [0.75 to 0.94]; p = 0.002). Red wine intake was negatively associated with asthma severity. The associations between apple and red wine consumption and asthma may indicate a protective effect of flavonoids.

We reviewed demographic and clinical data reported from April 23 through August 11, 2009, for all {H1N1-infected}, reproductive-age women who were hospitalized or died--nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and postpartum women (those who had delivered {\textless} or = 2 weeks previously). {RESULTS} Data were reported for 94 pregnant women, 8 postpartum women, and 137 nonpregnant women of reproductive age who were hospitalized with 2009 {H1N1} influenza. Rapid antigen tests were falsely negative in 38\% of the patients tested (58 of 153). Most pregnant patients (89 of 94 [95\%]) were in the second or third trimester, and approximately one third (32 of 93 [34\%]) had established risk factors for complications from influenza other than pregnancy. As compared with early antiviral treatment (administered {\textless} or = 2 days after symptom onset) in pregnant women, later treatment was associated with admission to an intensive care unit {(ICU)} or death (relative risk, 4.3). In all, 18 pregnant women and 4 postpartum women (total, 22 of 102 [22\%]) required intensive care, and 8 (8\%) died. Six deliveries occurred in the {ICU}, including four emergency cesarean deliveries. The 2009 {H1N1} influenza-specific maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) was 4.3. {CONCLUSIONS} 2009 {H1N1} influenza can cause severe illness and death in pregnant and postpartum women; regardless of the results of rapid antigen testing, prompt evaluation and antiviral treatment of influenza-like illness should be considered in such women. The high cause-specific maternal mortality rate suggests that 2009 {H1N1} influenza may increase the 2009 maternal mortality ratio in the United States.},

The performance of {ASSIGN} was comparable to that of {QRISK} on the same cohort. Models agreed on 93–97\% of categorical (high/lower) risk assessments and when they disagreed, {ASSIGN} was often closer to the estimated {Kaplan-Meier} incidence. {ASSIGN} also provided a steeper gradient of deprivation and discriminated between those with and without recorded family history of {CVD.} The estimated incidence was twice/three times as high for women/men with a recorded family history of {CVD.Conclusions} For systematic {CVD} risk assessment all models could usefully be applied, but {ASSIGN} improved on the gradient of deprivation and accounted for recorded family history whereas the Framingham equations did not. However, all models display relatively low specificity and sensitivity. An additional conclusion is that the recording of family history of {CVD} in primary care databases needs to improve given its importance in risk assessment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Mortality estimates alone are not sufficient to understand the true magnitude of cancer burden. We present the detailed estimates of mortality and incidence by site as the basis for the future estimation of cancer burden for the Global Burden of Disease 2000 study.


{METHODS}

Age- and sex- specific mortality envelope for all malignancies by region was derived from the analysis of country life-tables and cause of death. We estimated the site-specific cancer mortality distributions from vital records and cancer survival model. The regional cancer mortality by site is estimated by disaggregating the regional cancer mortality envelope based on the mortality distribution. Estimated incidence-to-mortality rate ratios were used to back calculate the final cancer incidence estimates by site.


{RESULTS}

In 2000, cancer accounted for over 7 million deaths (13\% of total mortality) and there were more than 10 million new cancer cases world wide in 2000. More than 60\% of cancer deaths and approximately half of new cases occurred in developing regions. Lung cancer was the most common cancers in the world, followed by cancers of stomach, liver, colon and rectum, and breast. There was a significant variations in the distribution of site-specific cancer mortality and incidence by region.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Despite a regional variation, the most common cancers are potentially preventable. Cancer burden estimation by taking into account both mortality and morbidity is an essential step to set research priorities and policy formulation. Also it can used for setting priorities when combined with data on costs of interventions against cancers.},

This process is a key element of a wider set of reform components aimed at extending health insurance, especially to the poor. The most relevant policy implications include lessons on the use of available and proven analytical tools to set national health priorities, the usefulness of priority-setting results to guide long-term capacity development, the importance of favouring an institutionalised approach to cost-effectiveness analysis, and the need for local technical capacity strengthening as an essential step to balance health-maximising arguments and other non-health criteria in a transparent and systematic process.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Data for trends in blood pressure are needed to understand the effects of its dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological determinants; set intervention priorities; and evaluate national programmes. However, few worldwide analyses of trends in blood pressure have been done. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean systolic blood pressure {(SBP).}


{METHODS}

We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean {SBP} for adults 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (786 country-years and 5·4 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {SBP} by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.


{FINDINGS}

In 2008, age-standardised mean {SBP} worldwide was 128·1 mm Hg (95\% uncertainty interval 126·7-129·4) in men and 124·4 mm Hg (123·0-125·9) in women. Globally, between 1980 and 2008, {SBP} decreased by 0·8 mm Hg per decade (-0·4 to 2·2, posterior probability of being a true decline=0·90) in men and 1·0 mm Hg per decade (-0·3 to 2·3, posterior probability=0·93) in women. Female {SBP} decreased by 3·5 mm Hg or more per decade in western Europe and Australasia (posterior probabilities ≥0·999). Male {SBP} fell most in high-income North America, by 2·8 mm Hg per decade (1·3-4·5, posterior probability {\textgreater}0·999), followed by Australasia and western Europe where it decreased by more than 2·0 mm Hg per decade (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·98). {SBP} rose in Oceania, east Africa, and south and southeast Asia for both sexes, and in west Africa for women, with the increases ranging 0·8-1·6 mm Hg per decade in men (posterior probabilities 0·72-0·91) and 1·0-2·7 mm Hg per decade for women (posterior probabilities 0·75-0·98). Female {SBP} was highest in some east and west African countries, with means of 135 mm Hg or greater. Male {SBP} was highest in Baltic and east and west African countries, where mean {SBP} reached 138 mm Hg or more. Men and women in western Europe had the highest {SBP} in high-income regions.


{INTERPRETATION}

On average, global population {SBP} decreased slightly since 1980, but trends varied significantly across regions and countries. {SBP} is currently highest in low-income and middle-income countries. Effective population-based and personal interventions should be targeted towards low-income and middle-income countries.

This paper reviews the literature to assess the extent to which current disparities are a consequence of racial differences in the social class composition of the {US} population. We focus this review on African Americans and examine studies that provide information on the effect of race on four outcome measures: infant mortality, hypertension, substance use, and mortality from all-causes. Twenty-three studies were identified that met criteria for inclusion in this review. As expected, most studies provide evidence that socioeconomic conditions are a major factor explaining racial differences in health. Findings, however, vary for the different health indices. Research in the area of substance abuse provides the most consistent evidence that socioeconomic conditions account for observed racial differences. In contrast, studies on infant mortality and hypertension provide a compelling case that the effects of socioeconomic status are important, but not sufficient to explain racial differences. Evidence on mortality from all-causes is equally divided between studies showing no significant race effect and those in which racial differences persist after adjusting for social class. The paper offers possible explanations for the seemingly divergent results and identifies conceptual and methodologic issues for future research seeking to disentangle the complex relations between race, social class, and health.},

	abstract = {Scrapie was transmitted to mice from ten sheep, collected in the {UK} between 1985 and 1994. As in previous natural scrapie transmissions, the results varied between scrapie sources in terms of the incidence of disease, incubation periods and neuropathology in challenged mice. This contrasted with the uniformity seen in transmissions of {BSE} to mice. The scrapie and {BSE} isolates were characterized further by serial passage in mice. Different {TSE} strains were isolated from each source according to the Sinc or {PrP} genotype of the mouse used for passage. The same two mouse-passaged strains, {301C} and {301V}, were isolated from each of three {BSE} sources. Despite the variation seen in the primary transmissions of scrapie, relatively few mouse-passaged scrapie strains were isolated and these were distinct from the {BSE-derived} strains. The {ME7} scrapie strain, which has often been isolated from independent sheep sources in the past, was identified in isolates from four of the sheep. However, a new distinct strain, {221C}, was derived from a further four scrapie sheep. These results suggest that there is agent strain variation in natural scrapie in sheep and that the spectrum of strains present may have changed over the last 20 years. The tested sample is too small to come to any conclusions about whether the {BSE} strain is present in sheep, but the study provides a framework for further more extensive studies.},

Maternal mortality remains a major challenge to health systems worldwide. Reliable information about the rates and trends in maternal mortality is essential for resource mobilisation, and for planning and assessment of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 {(MDG} 5), the target for which is a 75\% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio {(MMR)} from 1990 to 2015. We assessed levels and trends in maternal mortality for 181 {countries.Methods}
We constructed a database of 2651 observations of maternal mortality for 181 countries for 1980-2008, from vital registration data, censuses, surveys, and verbal autopsy studies. We used robust analytical methods to generate estimates of maternal deaths and the {MMR} for each year between 1980 and 2008. We explored the sensitivity of our data to model specification and show the out-of-sample predictive validity of our {methods.Findings}
We estimated that there were 342[punctuation space]900 (uncertainty interval 302[punctuation space]100-394[punctuation space]300) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008, down from 526[punctuation space]300 (446[punctuation space]400-629[punctuation space]600) in 1980. The global {MMR} decreased from 422 (358-505) in 1980 to 320 (272-388) in 1990, and was 251 (221-289) per 100[punctuation space]000 livebirths in 2008. The yearly rate of decline of the global {MMR} since 1990 was 1·3\% (1·0-1·5). During 1990-2008, rates of yearly decline in the {MMR} varied between countries, from 8·8\% (8·7-14·1) in the Maldives to an increase of 5·5\% (5·2-5·6) in Zimbabwe. More than 50\% of all maternal deaths were in only six countries in 2008 {(India}, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In the absence of {HIV}, there would have been 281[punctuation space]500 (243[punctuation space]900-327[punctuation space]900) maternal deaths worldwide in {2008.Interpretation}
Substantial, albeit varied, progress has been made towards {MDG} 5. Although only 23 countries are on track to achieve a 75\% decrease in {MMR} by 2015, countries such as Egypt, China, Ecuador, and Bolivia have been achieving accelerated {progress.Funding}

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Global efforts have increased the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of under-5 mortality; however, these estimates fail to use all data available, do not use transparent and reproducible methods, do not distinguish predictions from measurements, and provide no indication of uncertainty around point estimates. We aimed to develop new reproducible methods and reanalyse existing data to elucidate detailed time trends.
Methods
We merged available databases, added to them when possible, and then applied Loess regression to estimate past trends and forecast to 2015 for 172 countries. We developed uncertainty estimates based on different model specifications and estimated levels and trends in neonatal, post-neonatal, and childhood mortality.
Findings
Global under-5 mortality has fallen from 110 (109–110) per 1000 in 1980 to 72 (70–74) per 1000 in 2005. Child deaths worldwide have decreased from 13·5 (13·4–13·6) million in 1980 to an estimated 9·7 (9·5–10·0) million in 2005. Global under-5 mortality is expected to decline by 27\% from 1990 to 2015, substantially less than the target of Millennium Development Goal 4 {(MDG4)} of a 67\% decrease. Several regions in Latin America, north Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and southeast Asia have had consistent annual rates of decline in excess of 4\% over 35 years. Global progress on {MDG4} is dominated by slow reductions in {sub-Saharan} Africa, which also has the slowest rates of decline in fertility.
Interpretation
Globally, we are not doing a better job of reducing child mortality now than we were three decades ago. Further improvements in the quality and timeliness of child-mortality measurements should be possible by more fully using existing datasets and applying standard analytical strategies.},

India's {HIV} epidemic is not yet contained and prevention in populations most at risk (high-risk groups) needs to be enhanced and expanded. {HIV} prevalence as measured through surveillance of antenatal and sexually transmitted disease clinics is the chief source of information on {HIV} in India, but these data cannot provide real insight into where transmission is occurring or guide programme strategy. The factors that influence the Indian epidemic are the size, behaviours, and disease burdens of high-risk groups, their interaction with bridge populations and general population sexual networks, and migration and mobility of both bridge populations and high-risk groups. The interplay of these forces has resulted in substantial epidemics in several pockets of many Indian states that could potentially ignite subepidemics in other, currently low prevalence, parts of the country. The growth of {HIV}, unless contained, could have serious consequences for India's development. India's national response to {HIV} began in 1992 and has shown early success in some states. The priority is to build on those successes by increasing prevention coverage of high-risk groups to saturation level, enhancing access and uptake of care and treatment services, ensuring systems and capacity for evidence-based programming, and building in-country technical and managerial capacity.},

	abstract = {Summary
We reviewed interventions that affect maternal and child undernutrition and nutrition-related outcomes. These interventions included promotion of breastfeeding; strategies to promote complementary feeding, with or without provision of food supplements; micronutrient interventions; general supportive strategies to improve family and community nutrition; and reduction of disease burden (promotion of handwashing and strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy). We showed that although strategies for breastfeeding promotion have a large effect on survival, their effect on stunting is small. In populations with sufficient food, education about complementary feeding increased height-for-age Z score by 0·25 (95\% {CI} 0·01–0·49), whereas provision of food supplements (with or without education) in populations with insufficient food increased the height-for-age Z score by 0·41 (0·05–0·76). Management of severe acute malnutrition according to {WHO} guidelines reduced the case-fatality rate by 55\% (risk ratio 0·45, 0·32–0·62), and recent studies suggest that newer commodities, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, can be used to manage severe acute malnutrition in community settings. Effective micronutrient interventions for pregnant women included supplementation with iron folate (which increased haemoglobin at term by 12 {g/L}, 2·93–21·07) and micronutrients (which reduced the risk of low birthweight at term by 16\% (relative risk 0·84, 0·74–0·95). Recommended micronutrient interventions for children included strategies for supplementation of vitamin A (in the neonatal period and late infancy), preventive zinc supplements, iron supplements for children in areas where malaria is not endemic, and universal promotion of iodised salt. We used a cohort model to assess the potential effect of these interventions on mothers and children in the 36 countries that have 90\% of children with stunted linear growth. The model showed that existing interventions that were designed to improve nutrition and prevent related disease could reduce stunting at 36 months by 36\%; mortality between birth and 36 months by about 25\%; and disability-adjusted life-years associated with stunting, severe wasting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies by about 25\%. To eliminate stunting in the longer term, these interventions should be supplemented by improvements in the underlying determinants of undernutrition, such as poverty, poor education, disease burden, and lack of women's empowerment.},

In recent years, there have been dramatic improvements in our understanding of many aspects of this globally widespread parasite. This chapter reviews recent advances in our understanding in the biology, immunology, epidemiology, public health significance and control of hookworm, and to look forward to the study of this important parasite in the 21st century. Advances in molecular biology has lead to the identification of a variety of new molecules from hookworms, which have importance either in the molecular pathogenesis of hookworm infection or in the host-parasite relationship; some are also promising vaccine targets. At present, relatively little is known about the immune responses to hookworm infection, although it has recently been speculated that hookworm and other helminths may modulate specific immune responses to other pathogens and vaccines. Our epidemiological understanding of hookworm has improved through the development of mathematical models of transmission dynamics, which coupled with decades of field research across multiple epidemiological settings, have shown that certain population characteristics can now be recognised as common to the epidemiology, population biology and control of hookworm and other helminth species. Recent recognition of the subtle, but significant, impact of hookworm on health and education, together with the simplicity, safety, low cost and efficacy of chemotherapy has spurred international efforts to control the morbidity due to infection. Large-scale treatment programmes are currently underway, ideally supported by health education and integrated with the provision of improved water and sanitation. There are also on-going efforts to develop novel anthelmintic drugs and anti-hookworm vaccines.},

We observed a significant inverse association with combined total fruits and vegetables intake (estimated relative risk {(RR)} = 0.91; 95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI)} 0.83-1.00 per 80 g/d of consumption), and nearly significant inverse associations in separate analyses with total fruits and total vegetables intake {(RR:} 0.97 (95\% {CI:} 0.92-1.02) and {RR} = 0.89 (95\% {CI:} 0.78-1.02) per 40 g/d of consumption).

Restricted cubic spline regression did not improve the linear model fits except for total fruits and vegetables and total fruits with a significant decrease in risk at low intake levels ({\textless}120 g/d) for fruits.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Geographical variation in the distribution of variant {Creutzfeldt-Jakob} disease {(vCJD)} might indicate the transmission route of the infectious agent to man. We investigated whether regional incidences of {vCJD} were correlated with regional dietary data.
Methods
The National {CJD} Surveillance Unit prospectively identified 84 people with {vCJD} up to Nov 10, 2000, in Great Britain. Their lifetime residential histories were obtained by interviews with a close relative. Cumulative incidences of {vCJD} by standard region were calculated. Grid references for places of residence in 1991 were identified and evidence of geographical clusters were sought. Data on diet in the 1980s were analysed for regional correlations with {vCJD} incidence. The socioeconomic status of the places of residence of people with {vCJD} was compared with that of the general population.
Findings
{vCJD} incidence was higher in the north of Great Britain than the south. The rate ratio (north vs south) was 1·94 (95\% {CI} 1·27–2·98). The mean Carstairs' deprivation score for areas of residence of people with {vCJD} was −0·09 (−0·73 to 0·55), which is close to the national average of zero. Regional rates of {vCJD} were correlated with consumption of other meat or meat products as classified and recorded by the Household Food Consumption and Expenditure Survey (r=0·72), but not with data from the Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults. Five people with {vCJD} in Leicestershire formed a cluster (p=0·004).
Interpretation
Regional differences in {vCJD} incidence are unlikely to be due to ascertainment bias. We had difficulty determining whether regional variations in diet might cause these differences, since the results of dietary analyses were inconsistent.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries.


{METHODS}

Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis.


{RESULTS}

Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies.},

The association between daily mortality and daily temperatures in the Nethetlands in the period 1979–1987 was examined by controlling for influenza incidence, air pollution, and season; distinguishing lag periods; examining effect modification by wind speed and relative humidity; and distinguishing causes of death. Important direct effects of exposure to cold and heat on mortality were suggested by the following findings: 1) control for influenza incidence reduced cold-related mortality by only 34\% and reduced heat-related mortality by 23\% (the role of air pollution and “season” was negligible); 2) 62\% of the “unexplained” cold-related mortality, and all heat-related mortality, occurred within 1 week; and 3) effect modification by wind speed was in the expected direction. The finding that 57\% of “unexplained” cold-related mortality and 26\% of the “unexplained” heat-related mortality was attributable to cardiovascular diseases suggests that direct effects are only in part the result of increased stress on the circulatory system. For heat-related mortality, direct effects on the respiratory system are probably more important. For cold-related mortality, the analysis yielded evidence of an important indirect effect involving increased incidence of influenza and other respiratory infections.},

The three main soil-transmitted helminth infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm, are common clinical disorders in man. The gastrointestinal tract of a child living in poverty in a less developed country is likely to be parasitised with at least one, and in many cases all three soil-transmitted helminths, with resultant impairments in physical, intellectual, and cognitive development. The benzimidazole anthelmintics, mebendazole and albendazole, are commonly used to remove these infections. The use of these drugs is not limited to treatment of symptomatic soil-transmitted helminth infections, but also for large-scale prevention of morbidity in children living in endemic areas. As a result of data showing improvements in child health and education after deworming, and the burden of disease attributed to soil-transmitted helminths, the worldwide community is awakening to the importance of these infections. Concerns about the sustainability of periodic deworming with benzimidazole anthelmintics and the emergence of resistance have prompted efforts to develop and test new control tools.},

We reviewed progress between 1990 and 2010 in coverage of 26 key interventions in 68 Countdown priority countries accounting for more than 90\% of maternal and child deaths worldwide. 19 countries studied were on track to meet {MDG} 4, in 47 we noted acceleration in the yearly rate of reduction in mortality of children younger than 5 years, and in 12 countries progress had decelerated since 2000. Progress towards reduction of neonatal deaths has been slow, and maternal mortality remains high in most Countdown countries, with little evidence of progress. Wide and persistent disparities exist in the coverage of interventions between and within countries, but some regions have successfully reduced longstanding inequities. Coverage of interventions delivered directly in the community on scheduled occasions was higher than for interventions relying on functional health systems. Although overseas development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health has increased, funding for this sector accounted for only 31\% of all development assistance for health in 2007. We provide evidence from several countries showing that rapid progress is possible and that focused and targeted interventions can reduce inequities related to socioeconomic status and sex. However, much more can and should be done to address maternal and newborn health and improve coverage of interventions related to family planning, care around childbirth, and case management of childhood illnesses.},

The global problem of antimicrobial resistance is particularly pressing in developing countries, where the infectious disease burden is high and cost constraints prevent the widespread application of newer, more expensive agents. Gastrointestinal, respiratory, sexually transmitted, and nosocomial infections are leading causes of disease and death in the developing world, and management of all these conditions has been critically compromised by the appearance and rapid spread of resistance. In this first part of the review, we have summarised the present state of resistance in these infections from the available data. Even though surveillance of resistance in many developing countries is suboptimal, the general picture is one of accelerating rates of resistance spurred by antimicrobial misuse and shortfalls in infection control and public health. Reservoirs for resistance may be present in healthy human and animal populations. Considerable economic and health burdens emanate from bacterial resistance, and research is needed to accurately quantify the problem and propose and evaluate practicable solutions. In part {II}, to be published next month, we will review potential containment strategies that could address this burgeoning problem.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Up-to-date information on the causes of child deaths is crucial to guide global efforts to improve child survival. We report new estimates for 2008 of the major causes of death in children younger than 5 years.
Methods
We used multicause proportionate mortality models to estimate deaths in neonates aged 0–27 days and children aged 1–59 months, and selected single-cause disease models and analysis of vital registration data when available to estimate causes of child deaths. New data from China and India permitted national data to be used for these countries instead of predictions based on global statistical models, as was done previously. We estimated proportional causes of death for 193 countries, and by application of these proportions to the country-specific mortality rates in children younger than 5 years and birth rates, the numbers of deaths by cause were calculated for countries, regions, and the world.
Findings
Of the estimated 8·795 million deaths in children younger than 5 years worldwide in 2008, infectious diseases caused 68\% (5·970 million), with the largest percentages due to pneumonia (18\%, 1·575 million, uncertainty range {[UR]} 1·046 million–1·874 million), diarrhoea (15\%, 1·336 million, 0·822 million–2·004 million), and malaria (8\%, 0·732 million, 0·601 million–0·851 million). 41\% (3·575 million) of deaths occurred in neonates, and the most important single causes were preterm birth complications (12\%, 1·033 million, {UR} 0·717 million–1·216 million), birth asphyxia (9\%, 0·814 million, 0·563 million–0·997 million), sepsis (6\%, 0·521 million, 0·356 million–0·735 million), and pneumonia (4\%, 0·386 million, 0·264 million–0·545 million). 49\% (4·294 million) of child deaths occurred in five countries: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China.
Interpretation
These country-specific estimates of the major causes of child deaths should help to focus national programmes and donor assistance. Achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4, to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, is only possible if the high numbers of deaths are addressed by maternal, newborn, and child health interventions.

This study estimated morbidity and mortality attributable to substance abuse in Canada.


{METHODS}

Pooled estimates of relative risk were used to calculate etiologic fractions by age, gender, and province for 91 causes of disease or death attributable to alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.


{RESULTS}

There were 33,498 deaths and 208,095 hospitalizations attributed to tobacco, 6701 deaths and 86,076 hospitalizations due to alcohol, and 732 deaths and 7095 hospitalizations due to illicit drugs in 1992.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Substance abuse exacts a considerable toll on Canadian society in terms of morbidity and mortality, accounting for 21\% of deaths, 23\% of years of potential life lost, and 8\% of hospitalizations.},

Life expectancy and the probability of death before 70 years of age were analyzed by using life {tables.Results:} Large decreases in life expectancy were associated with overweight and obesity. Forty-year-old female nonsmokers lost 3.3 years and 40-year-old male nonsmokers lost 3.1 years of life expectancy because of overweight. Forty-year-old female nonsmokers lost 7.1 years and 40-year-old male nonsmokers lost 5.8 years because of obesity. Obese female smokers lost 7.2 years and obese male smokers lost 6.7 years of life expectancy compared with normal-weight smokers. Obese female smokers lost 13.3 years and obese male smokers lost 13.7 years compared with normal-weight nonsmokers. Body mass index at ages 30 to 49 years predicted mortality after ages 50 to 69 years, even after adjustment for body mass index at age 50 to 69 {years.Conclusions:} Obesity and overweight in adulthood are associated with large decreases in life expectancy and increases in early mortality. These decreases are similar to those seen with smoking. Obesity in adulthood is a powerful predictor of death at older ages. Because of the increasing prevalence of obesity, more efficient prevention and treatment should become high priorities in public health. {*For} members of the Netherlands Epidemiology and Demography Compression of Morbidity Research Group, see Appendix.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

This study sought to compare smoking behavior among Latino men and women from different countries of origin.


{METHODS}

A telephone-administered survey was conducted in 8 cities with Latino men and women of different national origin living in census tracts with at least 70\% Latino individuals.


{RESULTS}

A total of 8882 participants completed the survey; 53\% were women. The average age of respondents was 44 years; 63\% were foreign-born, and 59\% preferred Spanish for the interview. Current smoking was more prevalent among men (25.0\%, 95\% confidence interval {[CI]} = 23.7, 26.3) than among women (12.1\%, 95\% {CI} = 11.1, 13.0). Smoking rates were not significantly different by national origin among men, but Puerto Rican women had higher rates of smoking than other women. Central American men and women had the lowest smoking rates. Foreign-born respondents were less likely to be smokers (odds ratio {[OR]} = 0.77, 95\% {CI} = 0.66, 0.90) than {US-born} respondents, and respondents with 12 years or less of education had an increased odds of smoking {(OR} = 1.17, 95\% {CI} = 1.01, 1.35). High ac culturation was associated with more smoking in women {(OR} = 1.12, 95\% {CI} = 1.00-1.25) and less smoking in men {(OR} = 0.86, 95\% {CI} = 0.78-0.95). Puerto Rican and Cuban respondents were more likely to be current smokers and to smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Older, {US-born}, and more-educated respondents were less likely to be current smokers. Respondents of Puerto Rican and Cuban origin were more likely to smoke. Acculturation has divergent effects on smoking behavior by sex.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the rate of brain atrophy calculated from serial magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} registration as a surrogate marker of disease progression for use in clinical trials in Alzheimer disease {(AD).} Methods Eighteen patients with mild to moderate {AD} and 18 age-matched normal controls underwent 2 {MRI} brain scans separated by a 12-month interval. Each individual's later scan was registered to their first scan, and the volume of cerebral tissue loss calculated directly from the registered and subtracted {MRI} scan pairs. The mean and {SD} of the rate of brain volume changes were used to estimate the sample sizes that would be needed in a clinical trial with a drug anticipated to modify disease progression by varying degrees. Comparable sample size estimates were performed with data for other methods of monitoring rates of brain atrophy, extracted from published papers. Results The mean {(SD)} rate of brain atrophy for the patients with {AD} was 2.37\% (1.11\%) per year, while in the control group it was 0.41\% (0.47\%) per year. Based on these figures, to have 90\% power to detect a drug effect equivalent to a 20\% reduction in the rate of atrophy, 207 patients would be needed in each treatment arm. This assumes a 1-year placebo-controlled trial with a 10\% patient dropout rate, and that 10\% of scan pairs are unusable. Conclusion Registration of serial {MRI} volume images provides a powerful method of quantification of brain atrophy that can be used to monitor progression of {AD} in clinical trials.},

There is renewed interest in the potential contribution of community health workers to child survival. Community health workers can undertake various tasks, including case management of childhood illnesses (eg, pneumonia, malaria, and neonatal sepsis) and delivery of preventive interventions such as immunisation, promotion of healthy behaviour, and mobilisation of communities. Several trials show substantial reductions in child mortality, particularly through case management of ill children by these types of community interventions. However, community health workers are not a panacea for weak health systems and will need focussed tasks, adequate remuneration, training, supervision, and the active involvement of the communities in which they work. The introduction of large-scale programmes for community health workers requires evaluation to document the impact on child survival and cost effectiveness and to elucidate factors associated with success and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 {US} standard million population. A total of 1,399,790 new cancer cases and 564,830 deaths from cancer are expected in the United States in 2006. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for those younger than age 85 since 1999. Delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2002, but continued to increase by 0.3\% per year from 1987 through 2002 in women. Between 2002 and 2003, the actual number of recorded cancer deaths decreased by 778 in men, but increased by 409 in women, resulting in a net decrease of 369, the first decrease in the total number of cancer deaths since national mortality record keeping was instituted in 1930. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5\% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8\% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease for the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and for breast and colon and rectum cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women continues to increase slightly. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40\% and 18\% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in the tropics and neotropics. It is often referred to as a group of diseases because of the varied spectrum of clinical manifestations, which range from small cutaneous nodules to gross mucosal tissue destruction. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can be caused by several Leishmania spp and is transmitted to human beings and animals by sandflies. Despite its increasing worldwide incidence, but because it is rarely fatal, cutaneous leishmaniasis has become one of the so-called neglected diseases, with little interest by financial donors, public-health authorities, and professionals to implement activities to research, prevent, or control the disease. In endemic countries, diagnosis is often made clinically and, if possible, by microscopic examination of lesion biopsy smears to visually confirm leishmania parasites as the cause. The use of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques that allow for species identification is usually restricted to research or clinical settings in non-endemic countries. The mainstays of cutaneous leishmaniasis treatment are pentavalent antimonials, with new oral and topical treatment alternatives only becoming available within the past few years; a vaccine currently does not exist. Disease prevention and control are difficult because of the complexity of cutaneous leishmaniasis epizoology, and the few options available for effective vector control.},

This report reviews the resources that have been used to identify and recruit ethnic and racial minorities to participate in hereditary breast cancer research. Overall, hospital-based resources were used most often to identify potential subjects, and active recruitment methods were used most frequently to enroll eligible subjects. This review suggests that there appears to be a finite number of resources and strategies to identify and recruit potential subjects to participate in cancer genetics research; however, options for improving awareness about cancer genetics research among ethnic and racial minorities have not been extensively evaluated. To study ethnic and racial minority participation in cancer genetics research, stronger evaluation components will need to be integrated into research methods. Both observational and experimental studies are needed to determine resources that are most effective for identifying potential subjects who are ethnic and racial minorities and to evaluate the effects of different recruitment strategies on enrollment decisions among these populations.},

	abstract = {Despite the emphasis placed during the last two decades on public delivery of comprehensive and equitable primary care {(PC)} to developing country populations, coverage remains far from universal and the quality often poor. Users frequently patronise private providers, ranging from informal drug sellers to trained professionals. Interest is increasing internationally in the potential for making better use of private providers, including contractual approaches. The research aim was to examine the performance of different models of {PC} provision, in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses from the perspective of a government wishing to develop an overall strategy for improving {PC} provision. Models evaluated were: (a) South African general practitioners (district surgeons) providing services under public contracts; (b) clinics provided in Lesotho under a sub-contract between a construction company and a South African health care company; (c) {GP} services provided through an Independent Practitioner Association to low income insured workers and families; (d) a private clinic chain serving low income insured and uninsured workers and their families; and (e) for comparative purposes, South African public clinics. Performance was analysed in terms of provider cost and quality (of infrastructure, treatment practices, acceptability to patients and communities), allowing for differences in services and case-mix. The diversity of the arrangements made direct comparisons difficult, however, clear differences were identified between the models and conclusions drawn on their relative performance and the influences upon performance. The study findings demonstrate that contextual features strongly influence provider performance, and that a crude public/private comparison is not helpful. Key issues in contract design likely to influence performance are highlighted. Finally, the study argues that there is a need before contracting out service provision to consider how the performance of private providers might change when the context within which they are working changes with the introduction of a contract.},

Objective  To review the clinical and demographic characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women who died as a consequence of influenza A {H1N1} (2009) infection in Turkey. Design  A review of the records for pregnant and postpartum women who died as a consequence of {H1N1} influenza virus infection. Setting  Nationwide in Turkey. Population  Thirty-six pregnant or postpartum women who died as a result of confirmed pandemic {H1N1} influenza virus infection. Methods  Using the General Directorate of Mother and Child Health and Family Planning {(MCHFP)} Registry of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, we identified all pregnant and postpartum women who died as a result of confirmed influenza A {H1N1} (2009) infection between 29 October and 31 December 2009. Main outcome measure  Maternal mortality as a result of {H1N1} virus infection. Results  The average time from symptom onset to initial presentation for health care was approximately 2.5 days, and the mean time from symptom onset to the receipt of antiviral medication was approximately 5.5 days. Only one-fifth of all women received early antiviral treatment (administered 2 days or less after symptom onset) and only one woman was vaccinated for {H1N1} influenza 1 week before the onset of symptoms. The cause-specific maternal mortality ratio for {H1N1} influenza infection in Turkey was estimated to be 3.01. The calculated risk of death associated with {H1N1} influenza virus infection was approximately four times higher in pregnant and postpartum women than in the general population (relative risk, 3.88; 95\% confidence interval, 2.77-5.43). Conclusions  Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications of, and death from, {H1N1} influenza infection. Prompt evaluation and antiviral treatment of influenza-like illness should be considered in such women. Vaccination for {H1N1} influenza may reduce the total number of deaths in pregnant and postpartum women. The high cause-specific maternal mortality rate suggests that {H1N1} influenza virus infection may have increased the 2009 maternal mortality ratio in Turkey.},

Previous assessments have highlighted that less than a quarter of countries are on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 {(MDG} 4), which calls for a two-thirds reduction in mortality in children younger than 5 years between 1990 and 2015. In view of policy initiatives and investments made since 2000, it is important to see if there is acceleration towards the {MDG} 4 target. We assessed levels and trends in child mortality for 187 countries from 1970 to {2010.Methods}
We compiled a database of 16[punctuation space]174 measurements of mortality in children younger than 5 years for 187 countries from 1970 to 2009, by use of data from all available sources, including vital registration systems, summary birth histories in censuses and surveys, and complete birth histories. We used Gaussian process regression to generate estimates of the probability of death between birth and age 5 years. This is the first study that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate child mortality, and this technique has better out-of-sample predictive validity than do previous methods and captures uncertainty caused by sampling and non-sampling error across data types. Neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality was estimated from mortality in children younger than 5 years by use of the 1760 measurements from vital registration systems and complete birth histories that contained specific information about neonatal and postneonatal {mortality.Findings}
Worldwide mortality in children younger than 5 years has dropped from 11·9 million deaths in 1990 to 7·7 million deaths in 2010, consisting of 3·1 million neonatal deaths, 2·3 million postneonatal deaths, and 2·3 million childhood deaths (deaths in children aged 1-4 years). 33·0\% of deaths in children younger than 5 years occur in south Asia and 49·6\% occur in {sub-Saharan} Africa, with less than 1\% of deaths occurring in high-income countries. Across 21 regions of the world, rates of neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality are declining. The global decline from 1990 to 2010 is 2·1\% per year for neonatal mortality, 2·3\% for postneonatal mortality, and 2·2\% for childhood mortality. In 13 regions of the world, including all regions in {sub-Saharan} Africa, there is evidence of accelerating declines from 2000 to 2010 compared with 1990 to 2000. Within {sub-Saharan} Africa, rates of decline have increased by more than 1\% in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and The {Gambia.Interpretation}
Robust measurement of mortality in children younger than 5 years shows that accelerating declines are occurring in several low-income countries. These positive developments deserve attention and might need enhanced policy attention and {resources.Funding}

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Data for trends in serum cholesterol are needed to understand the effects of its dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological determinants; set intervention priorities; and evaluate national programmes. Previous analyses of trends in serum cholesterol were limited to a few countries, with no consistent and comparable global analysis. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean serum total cholesterol.


{METHODS}

We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean serum total cholesterol for adults 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (321 country-years and 3·0 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean total cholesterol by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.


{FINDINGS}

In 2008, age-standardised mean total cholesterol worldwide was 4·64 {mmol/L} (95\% uncertainty interval 4·51-4·76) for men and 4·76 {mmol/L} (4·62-4·91) for women. Globally, mean total cholesterol changed little between 1980 and 2008, falling by less than 0·1 {mmol/L} per decade in men and women. Total cholesterol fell in the high-income region consisting of Australasia, North America, and western Europe, and in central and eastern Europe; the regional declines were about 0·2 {mmol/L} per decade for both sexes, with posterior probabilities of these being true declines 0·99 or greater. Mean total cholesterol increased in east and southeast Asia and Pacific by 0·08 {mmol/L} per decade (-0·06 to 0·22, posterior probability=0·86) in men and 0·09 {mmol/L} per decade (-0·07 to 0·26, posterior probability=0·86) in women. Despite converging trends, serum total cholesterol in 2008 was highest in the high-income region consisting of Australasia, North America, and western Europe; the regional mean was 5·24 {mmol/L} (5·08-5·39) for men and 5·23 {mmol/L} (5·03-5·43) for women. It was lowest in {sub-Saharan} Africa at 4·08 {mmol/L} (3·82-4·34) for men and 4·27 {mmol/L} (3·99-4·56) for women.


{INTERPRETATION}

Nutritional policies and pharmacological interventions should be used to accelerate improvements in total cholesterol in regions with decline and to curb or prevent the rise in Asian populations and elsewhere. Population-based surveillance of cholesterol needs to be improved in low-income and middle-income countries.

There is a need for an accurate non-invasive diagnostic test for variant {Creutzfeldt-Jakob} disease {(vCJD).} We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of bilateral pulvinar high signal on magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} for the diagnosis of {vCJD.}
Methods
{MRI} from patients with {vCJD} and controls (patients with suspected {CJD)} were analysed. Scans were reviewed on two separate occasions by two neuroradiologists and scored for the distribution of changes, and likely final diagnosis. Scans from {vCJD} cases were reassessed to reach a consensus on all abnormalities.

We analysed 36 patients and 57 controls. {vCJD} patients were correctly identified based on bilateral pulvinar high signal in 29 of 36 and 32 of 36 cases on the first assessment by the two radiologists, and 32 of 36 and 31 of 36 on their second assessment. Bilateral increased pulvinar signal was identified in one of 57 and one of 57 controls on the first assessment and two of 57 and three of 57 controls on the second assessment. These reported changes in controls were graded as minimal/equivocal in six of seven patients and moderate in one (\&lt;0·5\% of all control assessments). 80\% of the assessments in {vCJD} cases were graded as moderate or substantial. On consensus review, 28 of 36 cases and none of 57 controls had prominent bilateral pulvinar signal—sensitivity 78\% (95\% {CL} 60–90\%) and specificity 100\% (95\% {CI} 94–100\%). Other common {MRI} features of {vCJD} were medial thalamic and periaqueductal grey matter high signal, and the notable absence of cerebral atrophy. Pulvinar high signal correlated with histological gliosis.
Interpretation
In the appropriate clinical context the {MRI} identification of bilaterally increased pulvinar signal is a useful non-invasive test for the diagnosis of {vCJD.}},

Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean fasting plasma glucose {(FPG)} and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and {territories.Methods}
We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2·7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {FPG} and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community {representative.Findings}
In 2008, global age-standardised mean {FPG} was 5·50 {mmol/L} (95\% uncertainty interval 5·37-5·63) for men and 5·42 {mmol/L} (5·29-5·54) for women, having risen by 0·07 {mmol/L} and 0·09 {mmol/L} per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9·8\% (8·6-11·2) in men and 9·2\% (8·0-10·5) in women in 2008, up from 8·3\% (6·5-10·4) and 7·5\% (5·8-9·6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127-182) million in 1980, to 347 (314-382) million in 2008. We recorded almost no change in mean {FPG} in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean {FPG} (6·09 {mmol/L}, 5·73-6·49 for men; 6·08 {mmol/L}, 5·72-6·46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15·5\%, 11·6-20·1 for men; and 15·9\%, 12·1-20·5 for women) in 2008. Mean {FPG} and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. Mean {FPG} in 2008 was lowest in {sub-Saharan} Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income {Asia-Pacific.} In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0·07 {mmol/L} per decade for men and 0·03 {mmol/L} per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0·18 {mmol/L} per decade for men and 0·14 {mmol/L} per decade for {women.Interpretation}
Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its {sequelae.Funding}

Cultural competence is a key element in improving communication between non-minority providers and minority patients.

Of special concern is the lack of cancer prevention communication between providers and their special population patients. More research is needed to understand cancer communication needs and barriers among special populations, and to direct effective interventions to improve consumer–provider communication for special populations. To this end, interactive training to improve communication skills among oncologists and medical students, increasing the availability of trained medical translators, increasing the number of health professionals from special populations, and increasing the number of special population participants in communication research are recommended. Furthermore, research should focus on identifying and overcoming cultural factors that negatively impact consumer–provider interactions.},

	abstract = {During the last quarter of the twentieth century, a number of works have addressed both the methodological and empirical aspects of population-wide impacts of major causes of diseases. This gradual establishment of risk assessment, or risk quantification, has been driven partly by the academic curiosity of individual researchers and partly by the demands of regulatory agencies and public policy for better quantitative evidence on the health implications of certain risk exposures. These efforts nonetheless have generally been within the disciplinary and methodological traditions of individual risk factors and in a limited number of settings. As a result, the criteria for evaluating scientific evidence have varied greatly across risk factors resulting in lack of comparability across risk factors. This book provides a comprehensive assessment of the scientific evidence on prevalence and hazards, and the resulting health effects, of a range of exposures that are known to be hazardous to human health, including childhood and maternal undernutrition, nutritional and physiological risk factors for adult health, addictive substances, sexual and reproductive health, and risks in the physical environments of households and communities, as well as among workers. This book is the culmination of over 3 years of scientific enquiry and data collection, collectively known as the Comparative Risk Assessment {(CRA)} project, involving over 100 scientists, applying a common analytical framework and methods to ensure greater consistency and comparability in using and evaluating scientific evidence across risks. As a result, our understanding of the comparative extent of disease burden caused by various exposures worldwide has advanced, and key areas of scientific enquiry to better inform policy needs to reduce risks have been elucidated. As public health researchers and practitioners evaluate policy alternatives for improving population health, this book not only demonstrates the enormous potential for disease prevention but also provides a fundamental reference for the scientific evidence on some of the most important global risks to {health.Volumes} 1 and 2 are hardbound; Volume 3 is a {CD-ROM.}},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Previous studies of variation in the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in health between countries have methodological drawbacks. We tried to overcome these difficulties in a large study that compared inequalities in morbidity and mortality between different countries in western Europe.
Methods
Data on four indicators of self-reported morbidity by level of education, occupational class, and/or level of income were obtained for 11 countries, and years ranging from 1985 to 1992. Data on total mortality by level of education and/or occupational class were obtained for nine countries for about 1980 to about 1990. We calculated odds ratios or rate ratios to compare a broad lower with a broad upper socioeconomic group. We also calculated an absolute measure for inequalities in mortality, a risk difference, which takes into account differences between countries in average rates of illhealth.
Findings
Inequalities in health were found in all countries. Odds ratios for morbidity ranged between about 1·5 and 2·5, and rate ratios for mortality between about 1·3 and 1·7. For men's perceived general health, for instance, inequalities by level of education in Norway were larger than in Switzerland or Spain (odds ratios [95\% {CI]:} 2·57 [2·07–3·18], 1·60 [1·30–1·96], 1·65 [1·44–1·88], respectively). For mortality by occupational class, in men aged 30–44, the rate ratio was highest in Finland (1·76 [1·69–1·83]), although there was no large difference in the size of the inequality in those countries with data. For men aged 45–59, for whom France did have data, this country had the largest inequality (1·71 [1·66–1·77]). In the agegroup 45–64, the absolute risk difference ranked Finland second after France (9·8\% [9·1–10·4], 11·5\% [10·7–12·4]), with Sweden and Norway coming out more favourably than on the basis of rate ratios. In a scatter-plot of average rank scores for morbidity versus mortality, Sweden and Norway had larger relative inequalities in health than most other countries for both measures; France fared badly for mortality but was average for morbidity.
Interpretation
Our results challenge conventional views on the between-country pattern of inequalities in health in western European countries.},

Although estimates of prevalence are available from different studies, a lack of standardization makes comparisons difficult. Objective: This study was conducted to estimate the variation of geometric mean levels of serum {IgE} and the prevalence of specific {IgE} to common allergens between populations as part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey {(ECRHS)}, a multicenter survey of asthma and risk factors for asthma. Methods: Random samples of subjects living in 37 centers in 16 countries who had answered a questionnaire about their respiratory symptoms were invited for further assessment including total serum {IgE} and the presence of specific {IgE} against house dust mite {(Dermatophagoides} pteronyssinus), timothy grass, cat, Cladosporium herbarum, and a local allergen. Sera were tested from 13,883 persons. Results: The estimated prevalence of atopy, defined as the presence of at least one positive specific {IgE}, ranged from 16\% in Albacete {(Spain)} to 45\% in Christchurch {(New} Zealand). The geometric mean total serum {IgE} varied from 13 {kU/L} in Reykjavik {(Iceland)} to 62 {kU/L} in Bordeaux {(France).} There was no relation between the geometric mean total serum {IgE} in a center and the prevalence of atopy. Conclusions: There are substantial variations in the prevalence of atopy and the level of serum {IgE.} These variations are independent of each other and likely to be largely environmental in origin. {(J} Allergy Clin Immunol 1997;99:314-22.)},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with lower rates of coronary heart disease. Results from observational studies suggest a similar association with stroke.


{OBJECTIVE}

To assess the evidence from prospective observational studies on fruit and vegetable intake and risk of stroke.


{METHODS}

A meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted to examine the association between fruit and vegetable intake and stroke. Studies were selected if they reported relative risk {(RR)} and 95\% {CI} for any type of stroke and used a validated questionnaire for food intake assessment. Pooled {RR} were calculated and linearity of the associations was examined.


{RESULTS}

Seven studies were eligible for the meta-analysis, including 90,513 men, 141,536 women, and 2,955 strokes. The risk of stroke was decreased by 11\% {(RR} 95\% {CI:} 0.89 [0.85 to 0.93]) for each additional portion per day of fruit, by 5\% {(RR:} 0.95 [0.92 to 0.97]) for fruit and vegetables, and by 3\% {(RR:} 0.97 [0.92 to 1.02]; {NS)} for vegetables. The association between fruit or fruit and vegetables and stroke was linear, suggesting a dose-response relationship.


{CONCLUSIONS}

This meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that fruit and fruit and vegetable consumption decreases the risk of stroke.},

	abstract = {Background: Zinc deficiency is prevalent in children in developing countries. Supplemental zinc provides therapeutic benefits in diarrhea. Objective: We sought to measure the effect of supplemental zinc given with oral rehydration therapy during recovery from acute or persistent diarrhea. Design: We conducted pooled analyses including all available published and unpublished randomized controlled trials of the effects of supplementary oral zinc in children aged {\textless}5 y with acute or persistent diarrhea. We used Cox survival regression analysis to evaluate the overall effect of zinc on continuation of diarrhea and possible differential effects in subgroups divided by sex, age, weight-for-height, and initial plasma zinc concentration. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by logistic regression. To assess the effects of excluding studies without original data from the pooled analyses, effect-size was estimated for all studies by using random-effects models. Results: Zinc-supplemented children had a 15\% lower probability of continuing diarrhea on a given day (95\% {CI:} 5\%, 24\%) in the acute-diarrhea trials and a 24\% lower probability of continuing diarrhea (95\% {CI:} 9\%, 37\%) and a 42\% lower rate of treatment failure or death (95\% {CI:} 10\%, 63\%) in the persistent-diarrhea trials. In none of the subgroup analyses were the 2 subgroups of each pair significantly different from each other; however, in persistent diarrhea there tended to be a greater effect in subjects aged {\textless}12 mo, who were male, or who had wasting or lower baseline plasma zinc concentrations. Conclusion: Zinc supplementation reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea.},

	abstract = {Summary
We reviewed interventions that affect maternal and child undernutrition and nutrition-related outcomes. These interventions included promotion of breastfeeding; strategies to promote complementary feeding, with or without provision of food supplements; micronutrient interventions; general supportive strategies to improve family and community nutrition; and reduction of disease burden (promotion of handwashing and strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy). We showed that although strategies for breastfeeding promotion have a large effect on survival, their effect on stunting is small. In populations with sufficient food, education about complementary feeding increased height-for-age Z score by 0·25 (95\% {CI} 0·01–0·49), whereas provision of food supplements (with or without education) in populations with insufficient food increased the height-for-age Z score by 0·41 (0·05–0·76). Management of severe acute malnutrition according to {WHO} guidelines reduced the case-fatality rate by 55\% (risk ratio 0·45, 0·32–0·62), and recent studies suggest that newer commodities, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, can be used to manage severe acute malnutrition in community settings. Effective micronutrient interventions for pregnant women included supplementation with iron folate (which increased haemoglobin at term by 12 {g/L}, 2·93–21·07) and micronutrients (which reduced the risk of low birthweight at term by 16\% (relative risk 0·84, 0·74–0·95). Recommended micronutrient interventions for children included strategies for supplementation of vitamin A (in the neonatal period and late infancy), preventive zinc supplements, iron supplements for children in areas where malaria is not endemic, and universal promotion of iodised salt. We used a cohort model to assess the potential effect of these interventions on mothers and children in the 36 countries that have 90\% of children with stunted linear growth. The model showed that existing interventions that were designed to improve nutrition and prevent related disease could reduce stunting at 36 months by 36\%; mortality between birth and 36 months by about 25\%; and disability-adjusted life-years associated with stunting, severe wasting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies by about 25\%. To eliminate stunting in the longer term, these interventions should be supplemented by improvements in the underlying determinants of undernutrition, such as poverty, poor education, disease burden, and lack of women's empowerment.},

To track donor assistance to maternal, newborn, and child health-related activities is necessary to assess progress towards Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 and to foster donor accountability.

We analysed and coded the complete aid activities database for 2005 and 2006 with methods that we developed previously to track official development assistance. For the 68 Countdown priority countries, we report two indicators for use in monitoring donor disbursements: official development assistance to child health per child and official development assistance to maternal and neonatal health per {livebirth.Findings}
Donor disbursements increased from {US\$2119} million in 2003 to \$3482 million in 2006; funding for child health increased by 63\% and that for maternal and newborn health increased by 66\%. In the 68 priority countries, child-related disbursements increased from a mean of \$4 per child in 2003 to \$7 per child in 2006; disbursements for maternal and neonatal health increased from \$7 per livebirth in 2003 to \$12 per livebirth in 2006. Nonetheless, disbursements fell in some countries. After adjustment for other determinants, countries with higher under-5 mortality received more official development assistance per child, but official development assistance to maternal and newborn health did not seem to be well targeted towards countries with the greatest maternal health {needs.Interpretation}
Donor resource tracking should be continued to help hold donors accountable and encourage targeting of resources to countries with greatest {needs.Funding}

This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data through 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 {US} standard million population. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are projected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by 0.3\% per year in women; and a 13.6\% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates among men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute number of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by more than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

	abstract = {A community-based programme to ensure prompt and adequate treatment of presumptive episodes of clinical malaria in children has been established in a rural province of Burkina Faso. The implementation strategy was based on training a core group of mothers in every village and supplying community health workers with essential antimalarial drugs specially packed in age-specific bags containing a full course of treatment. Drugs were sold under a cost-recovery scheme. The programme was run in 1994 by the national malaria control centre {(CNLP)}, and in 1995 it was devolved to the provincial health team {(PHT).} Knowledge and awareness of malaria increased with the intervention. Drug consumption by age group was compatible with the distribution of disease, and no major problem of misuse emerged. The actual implementation costs of the intervention were {US\$} 0·06 per child living in the province. An evaluation of the impact of the intervention on the severity of malaria, using routine data from the health information system and taking as an indicator the proportion of malaria cases which were recorded as severe in health centres, was performed. In 1994, when the intervention was implemented on a provincial scale by {CNLP}, this proportion was lower than the average of the 4 preceding years (3·7\% vs. 4·9\%). In 1995, when the programme was implemented by the {PHT}, the proportion of severe cases was lower in health centres achieving a programme coverage of ≥50\% in their catchment area compared with the others (4·2\% vs. 6·1\%). Our experience shows that a low-cost, community-based intervention aimed at providing children with prompt and adequate treatment of presumptive episodes of clinical malaria is feasible, and suggests that it may lead to a reduction in the morbidity from severe malaria.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Intervention strategies are available for reducing the high global burden of hazardous alcohol use as a risk factor for disease, but little is known about their potential costs and effects at a population level. This study set out to estimate these costs and effects.


{METHOD}

Analyses were carried out for 12 epidemiological World Health Organization subregions of the world. A population model was used to estimate the impact of evidence-based personal and nonpersonal interventions--including brief physician advice, taxation, roadside random breath testing, restricted sales access and advertising bans. Costs were measured in international dollars {(I\$);} population-level intervention effects were gauged in terms of disability-adjusted life years {(DALYs)} averted. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios {(CERs)} were computed.


{RESULTS}

The most costly interventions to implement are brief advice in primary care and roadside breath testing of drivers. In populations with a high prevalence of heavy drinkers (more than 5\%, such as Europe and North America), the most effective and cost-effective intervention was taxation (more than 500 {DALYs} averted per 1 million population; {CER} {\textless} I\$500 per {DALY} averted). In populations with a lower prevalence of heavy drinking, however, taxation is estimated to be less cost effective overall than other, more targeted strategies, such as brief physician advice, roadside breath testing and advertising bans.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The most efficient public health response to the burden of alcohol use depends on the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use, which is related to overall per capita consumption. Population-wide measures, such as taxation, are expected to represent the most cost-effective response in populations with moderate or high levels of drinking, whereas more targeted strategies are indicated in populations with lower rates of hazardous alcohol use.},

	abstract = {This paper represents the first attempt to apply vertical equity principles to the South African health sector. A vertical equity approach, which recognises that different groups have different starting points and therefore require differential treatment, appears to offer an appropriate basis for considering how best to redress the vast inequities which exist in {post-Apartheid} South Africa. Vertical equity principles are applied in critically analysing two areas of recent policy action which are particularly relevant to health sector equity in South Africa, namely public-private sector cross-subsidies and the allocation of government resources between provinces. Despite a strong political commitment to redressing historical inequities, recent government policy actions in these two areas appear to fall short of desirable goals when viewed through a vertical equity lens. In particular, policies since the first democratic elections in 1994 have done little to reduce the extent of government subsidies to the private health sector, which serves a minority of the population. In addition, recent proposals for a Social Health Insurance will allow minimal cross-subsidies between high- and low-income earners and would not adequately redress the currently inequitable public-private cross-subsidies. With respect to the allocation of government resources between provinces, a vertical equity approach would suggest that the most historically dis-advantaged provinces have an even greater claim on government resources than reflected in the current formula, as developed by the Department of Finance. This paper also considers the potential benefits of engaging with societal views in determining what constitutes dis-advantage in the South African context, in order to identify those who should receive priority in resource allocation decisions. It concludes with a review of a number of practical steps that can be taken to draw vertical equity principles into policy action.},

Molecular approaches to the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation in these settings could potentially limit intimal expansion. This problem was approached by introducing adenoviral vectors encoding the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) into porcine arteries that had been injured by a balloon on a catheter. These smooth muscle cells were shown to be infectable with adenoviral vectors, and introduction of the tk gene rendered them sensitive to the nucleoside analog ganciclovir. When this vector was introduced into porcine arteries immediately after a balloon injury, intimal hyperplasia decreased after a course of ganciclovir treatment. No major local or systemic toxicities were observed. These data suggest that transient expression of an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a cytotoxic drug locally may limit smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to balloon injury.},

	abstract = {Summary
In this second article of the neonatal survival series, we identify 16 interventions with proven efficacy (implementation under ideal conditions) for neonatal survival and combine them into packages for scaling up in health systems, according to three service delivery modes (outreach, family-community, and facility-based clinical care). All the packages of care are cost effective compared with single interventions. Universal (99\%) coverage of these interventions could avert an estimated 41–72\% of neonatal deaths worldwide. At 90\% coverage, intrapartum and postnatal packages have similar effects on neonatal mortality—two-fold to three-fold greater than that of antenatal care. However, running costs are two-fold higher for intrapartum than for postnatal care. A combination of universal—ie, for all settings—outreach and family-community care at 90\% coverage averts 18–37\% of neonatal deaths. Most of this benefit is derived from family-community care, and greater effect is seen in settings with very high neonatal mortality. Reductions in neonatal mortality that exceed 50\% can be achieved with an integrated, high-coverage programme of universal outreach and family-community care, consisting of 12\% and 26\%, respectively, of total running costs, plus universal facility-based clinical services, which make up 62\% of the total cost. Early success in averting neonatal deaths is possible in settings with high mortality and weak health systems through outreach and family-community care, including health education to improve home-care practices, to create demand for skilled care, and to improve care seeking. Simultaneous expansion of clinical care for babies and mothers is essential to achieve the reduction in neonatal deaths needed to meet the Millennium Development Goal for child survival.

In Thailand, various community financing schemes were developed through the process of primary health care. These are considered as part of the total community development rather than a mere source of financial support for health services. While the coverage of community funds amounted to almost 50\% of the rural villages, the total amount of the funds was less than 1\% of the total health expenditure of the {country.Village} drug funds were the first scheme to be developed in 1980. These were very successful, with a continuation rate (until 1988) of up to 80.94\%. The coverage of rural villages was almost 50\%, and the total fund amounted to 60 million bahts. The nutrition fund was the least successful scheme, due to its particular activities, low acceptance among the people, and limited capital appreciation. It now no longer exists. Sanitation and health card funds are fairly successful. They have higher capital appreciation and diverse sources of income. They contribute to the higher provision of environmental sanitation and basic medical {services.Many} single purpose funds were diversified into multipurpose health development funds or into multipurpose village development funds. Four major factors which have contributed to the success/failure of community financing schemes: government policy, support from health personnel, community infrastructure, and type of funds, are explored.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To derive a new cardiovascular disease risk score {(QRISK)} for the United Kingdom and to validate its performance against the established Framingham cardiovascular disease algorithm and a newly developed Scottish score {(ASSIGN).}


{DESIGN}

Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from general practice.


{SETTING}

{UK} practices contributing to the {QRESEARCH} database.


{PARTICIPANTS}

The derivation cohort consisted of 1.28 million patients, aged 35-74 years, registered at 318 practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007 and who were free of diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The validation cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

First recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (incident diagnosis between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007): myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attacks. Risk factors were age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol to high density lipoprotein, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative aged less than 60, area measure of deprivation, and existing treatment with antihypertensive agent.


{RESULTS}

A cardiovascular disease risk algorithm {(QRISK)} was developed in the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort the observed 10 year risk of a cardiovascular event was 6.60\% (95\% confidence interval 6.48\% to 6.72\%) in women and 9.28\% (9.14\% to 9.43\%) in men. Overall the Framingham algorithm over-predicted cardiovascular disease risk at 10 years by 35\%, {ASSIGN} by 36\%, and {QRISK} by 0.4\%. Measures of discrimination tended to be higher for {QRISK} than for the Framingham algorithm and it was better calibrated to the {UK} population than either the Framingham or {ASSIGN} models. Using {QRISK} 8.5\% of patients aged 35-74 are at high risk (20\% risk or higher over 10 years) compared with 13\% when using the Framingham algorithm and 14\% when using {ASSIGN.} Using {QRISK} 34\% of women and 73\% of men aged 64-75 would be at high risk compared with 24\% and 86\% according to the Framingham algorithm. {UK} estimates for 2005 based on {QRISK} give 3.2 million patients aged 35-74 at high risk, with the Framingham algorithm predicting 4.7 million and {ASSIGN} 5.1 million. Overall, 53 668 patients in the validation dataset (9\% of the total) would be reclassified from high to low risk or vice versa using {QRISK} compared with the Framingham algorithm.


{CONCLUSION}

{QRISK} performed at least as well as the Framingham model for discrimination and was better calibrated to the {UK} population than either the Framingham model or {ASSIGN.} {QRISK} is likely to provide more appropriate risk estimates to help identify high risk patients on the basis of age, sex, and social deprivation. It is therefore likely to be a more equitable tool to inform management decisions and help ensure treatments are directed towards those most likely to benefit. It includes additional variables which improve risk estimates for patients with a positive family history or those on antihypertensive treatment. However, since the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further validation in other populations is therefore required.},

	abstract = {Soil-transmitted helminth {(STH)} infections are among the most prevalent of chronic human infections worldwide. Based on the demonstrable impact on child development, there is a global commitment to finance and implement control strategies with a focus on school-based chemotherapy programmes. The major obstacle to the implementation of cost-effective control is the lack of accurate descriptions of the geographical distribution of infection. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the use of geographical information systems {(GIS)} and remote sensing {(RS)} to better understand helminth ecology and epidemiology, and to develop low-cost ways to identify target populations for treatment. This review explores how this information has been used practically to guide large-scale control programmes. The use of satellite-derived environmental data has yielded new insights into the ecology of infection at a geographical scale that has proven impossible to address using more traditional approaches, and has in turn allowed spatial distributions of infection prevalence to be predicted robustly by statistical approaches. {GIS/RS} have increasingly been used in the context of large-scale helminth control programmes, including not only {STH} infections but also those focusing on schistosomiasis, filariasis and onchocerciasis. The experience indicates that {GIS/RS} provides a cost-effective approach to designing and monitoring programmes at realistic scales. Importantly, the use of this approach has begun to transition from being a specialist approach of international vertical programmes to becoming a routine tool in developing public sector control programmes. {GIS/RS} is used here to describe the global distribution of {STH} infections and to estimate the number of infections in school-age children in {sub-Saharan} Africa (89.9 million) and the annual cost of providing a single anthelmintic treatment using a school-based approach {(US\$5.0–7.6} million). These are the first estimates at a continental scale to explicitly include the fine spatial distribution of infection prevalence and population, and suggest that traditional methods have overestimated the situation. The results suggest that continent-wide control of parasites is, from a financial perspective, an attainable goal.},

Alcohol consumption has been identified as an important risk factor for chronic disease and injury. In the first paper in this Series, we quantify the burden of mortality and disease attributable to alcohol, both globally and for ten large countries. We assess alcohol exposure and prevalence of alcohol-use disorders on the basis of reviews of published work. After identification of other major disease categories causally linked to alcohol, we estimate attributable fractions by sex, age, and {WHO} region. Additionally, we compare social costs of alcohol in selected countries. The net effect of alcohol consumption on health is detrimental, with an estimated 3·8\% of all global deaths and 4·6\% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol. Disease burden is closely related to average volume of alcohol consumption, and, for every unit of exposure, is strongest in poor people and in those who are marginalised from society. The costs associated with alcohol amount to more than 1\% of the gross national product in high-income and middle-income countries, with the costs of social harm constituting a major proportion in addition to health costs. Overall, we conclude that alcohol consumption is one of the major avoidable risk factors, and actions to reduce burden and costs associated with alcohol should be urgently increased.},

There has been speculation for nearly a century as to the identity of the anticoagulant substances) used by these organisms to subvert host hemostasis. Using molecular cloning, we describe a family of potent small protein (75-84 amino acids) anticoagulants from the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum termed {AcAP} {(A.} caninum anticoagulant protein). Two recombinant {AcAP} members {(AcAP5} and {AcAP6)} directly inhibited the catalytic activity of blood coagulation factor Xa {(fXa)}, while a third form {(AcAPc2)} predominantly inhibited the catalytic activity of a complex composed of blood coagulation factor {VIIa} and tissue factor {(fVIIa/TF).} The inhibition of {fVIIa/TF} was by a unique mechanism that required the initial formation of a binary complex of the inhibitor with {fXa} at a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the catalytic center (exo-site). The sequence of {AcAPc2} as well as the utilization of an exo-site on {fXa} distinguishes this inhibitor from the mammalian anticoagulant {TFPI} (tissue factor pathway inhibitor), which is functionally equivalent with respect to {fXa-dependent} inhibition of {fIIa/TF.} The relative sequence positions of the reactive site residues determined for {AcAP5} with the homologous regions in {AcAP6} and {AcAPc2} as well as the pattern of 10 cysteine residues present in each of the inhibitors suggest that the {AcAPs} are distantly related to the family of small protein serine protease inhibitors found in the nonhematophagous nematode Ascaris lumbricoides var. suum.},

Explicit priority setting presents Mexico with the opportunity to match the pressure and complexity of an advancing epidemiological transition with evidence-based policies driven by a fundamental concern for how to make the best use of scarce resources to improve population health. The Mexican priority-setting experience describes how standardised analytical approaches to decision making, mainly burden of disease and cost-effectiveness analyses, combine with other criteria—eg, being responsive to the legitimate non-health expectations of patients and ensuring fair financing across households—to design and implement a set of three differentiated health intervention packages. This process is a key element of a wider set of reform components aimed at extending health insurance, especially to the poor. The most relevant policy implications include lessons on the use of available and proven analytical tools to set national health priorities, the usefulness of priority-setting results to guide long-term capacity development, the importance of favouring an institutionalised approach to cost-effectiveness analysis, and the need for local technical capacity strengthening as an essential step to balance health-maximising arguments and other non-health criteria in a transparent and systematic process.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Given the size of the {HIV} epidemic in South Africa and other developing countries, scaling up antiretroviral treatment {(ART)} represents one of the key public health challenges of the next decade. Appropriate priority setting and budgeting can be assisted by economic data on the costs and cost-effectiveness of {ART.} The objectives of this research were therefore to estimate {HIV} healthcare utilisation, the unit costs of {HIV} services and the cost per life year {(LY)} and quality adjusted life year {(QALY)} gained of {HIV} treatment interventions from a provider's perspective.


{METHODS}

Data on service utilisation, outcomes and costs were collected in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Utilisation of a full range of {HIV} healthcare services was estimated from 1,729 patients in the Khayelitsha cohort (1,146 {No-ART} patient-years, 2,229 {ART} patient-years) using a before and after study design. Full economic costs of {HIV-related} services were calculated and were complemented by appropriate secondary data. {ART} effects (deaths, therapy discontinuation and switching to second-line) were from the same 1,729 patients followed for a maximum of 4 years on {ART.} {No-ART} outcomes were estimated from a local natural history cohort. Health-related quality of life was assessed on a sub-sample of 95 patients. Markov modelling was used to calculate lifetime costs, {LYs} and {QALYs} and uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis on all utilisation and outcome variables. An alternative scenario was constructed to enhance generalizability.


{RESULTS}

Discounted lifetime costs for {No-ART} and {ART} were {US\$2},743 and {US\$9},435 over 2 and 8 {QALYs} respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio through the use of {ART} versus {No-ART} was {US\$1},102 (95\% {CI} 1,043-1,210) per {QALY} and {US\$984} (95\% {CI} 913-1,078) per life year gained. In an alternative scenario where adjustments were made across cost, outcome and utilisation parameters, costs and outcomes were lower, but the {ICER} was similar.


{CONCLUSION}

Decisions to scale-up {ART} across {sub-Saharan} Africa have been made in the absence of incremental lifetime cost and cost-effectiveness data which seriously limits attempts to secure funds at the global level for {HIV} treatment or to set priorities at the country level. This article presents baseline cost-effectiveness data from one of the longest running public healthcare antiretroviral treatment programmes in Africa that could assist in enhancing efficient resource allocation and equitable access to {HIV} treatment.},

While much of the analysis of health reform programmes has looked at design issues, assuming that a technically sound design is the primary requirement of effective policy change, this paper explores the political and bureaucratic realities shaping the pattern of policy change and its impacts. Through a case study approach, it provides a picture of the policy environment and processes in the two countries, specifically considering the extent to which technical analysts and technical knowledge were able to shape policy {change.The} two countries’ experiences indicate the strong influence of political factors and actors over which health care financing policies were implemented, and which not, as well as over the details of policy design. Moments of political transition in both countries provided political leaders, specifically Ministers of Health, with windows of opportunity in which to introduce new policies. However, these transitions, and the changes in administrative structures introduced with them, also created environments that constrained the processes of reform design and implementation and limited the equity and sustainability gains achieved by the policies. Technical analysts, working either inside or outside government, had varying and often limited influence. In part, this reflected the limits of their own capacity as well as weaknesses in the way they were used in policy development. In addition, the analysts were constrained by the fact that their preferred policies often received only weak political support. Focusing almost exclusively on designing policy reforms, these analysts gave little attention to generating adequate support for the policy options they proposed. Finally, the country experiences showed that front-line health workers, middle level managers and the public had important influences over policy implementation and its impacts. The limited attention given to communicating policy changes to, or consulting with, these actors only heightened the potential for reforms to result in unanticipated and unwanted {impacts.The} strength of the paper lies in its ‘thick description’ of the policy process in each country, an empirical case study approach to policy that is under-represented in the literature. While such an approach allows only a cautious drawing of general conclusions, it suggests a number of ways in which to strengthen the implementation of financing policies in each country.},

To achieve the Millennium Development Goal for child survival {(MDG-4)}, neonatal deaths need to be prevented. Previous papers in this series have presented the size of the problem, discussed cost-effective interventions, and outlined a systematic approach to overcoming health-system constraints to scaling up. We address issues related to improving neonatal survival. Countries should not wait to initiate action. Success is possible in low-income countries and without highly developed technology. Effective, low-cost interventions exist, but are not present in programmes. Specific efforts are needed by safe motherhood and child survival programmes. Improved availability of skilled care during childbirth and family/community-based care through postnatal home visits will benefit mothers and their newborn babies. Incorporation of management of neonatal illness into the integrated management of childhood illness initiative {(IMCI)} will improve child survival. Engagement of the community and promotion of demand for care are crucial. To halve neonatal mortality between 2000 and 2015 should be one of the targets of {MDG-4.} Development, implementation, and monitoring of national action plans for neonatal survival is a priority. We estimate the running costs of the selected packages at 90\% coverage in the 75 countries with the highest mortality rates to be {US\$4·1} billion a year, in addition to current expenditures of \$2·0 billion. About 30\% of this money would be for interventions that have specific benefit for the newborn child; the remaining 70\% will also benefit mothers and older children, and substantially reduce rates of stillbirths. The cost per neonatal death averted is estimated at \$2100 (range \$1700–3100). Maternal, neonatal, and child health receive little funding relative to the large numbers of deaths. International donors and leaders of developing countries should be held accountable for meeting their commitments and increasing resources.

Causes of adult death are important components of Millennium Development Goals 5 and 6. However, adult mortality has received little policy attention, resources, or monitoring efforts. This study aimed to estimate worldwide mortality in men and women aged 15-59 {years.Methods{\textless}br/{\textgreater}We} compiled a database of 3889 measurements of adult mortality for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010 using vital registration data and census and survey data for deaths in the household corrected for completeness, and sibling history data from surveys corrected for survival bias. We used Gaussian process regression to generate yearly estimates of the probability of death between the ages of 15 years and 60 years (45q15) for men and women for every country with uncertainty intervals that indicate sampling and non-sampling error. We showed that these analytical methods have good predictive validity for countries with missing {data.Findings{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Adult} mortality varied substantially across countries and over time. In 2010, the countries with the lowest risk of mortality for men and women are Iceland and Cyprus, respectively. In Iceland, male 45q15 is 65 (uncertainty interval 61-69) per 1000; in Cyprus, female 45q15 is 38 (36-41) per 1000. Highest risk of mortality in 2010 is seen in Swaziland for men (45q15 of 765 [692-845] per 1000) and Zambia for women (606 [518-708] per 1000). Between 1970 and 2010, substantial increases in adult mortality occurred in {sub-Saharan} Africa because of the {HIV} epidemic and in countries in or related to the former Soviet Union. Other regional trends were also seen, such as stagnation in the decline of adult mortality for large countries in southeast Asia and a striking decline in female mortality in south {Asia.Interpretation{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The} prevention of premature adult death is just as important for global health policy as the improvement of child survival.

A study-based model was applied to obtain estimates for 111 high-mortality countries. Uncertainty estimates were derived using the jackknife {approach.Results} Data from 44 countries with {VR} (96 797 neonatal deaths) and from 56 studies (29 countries, 13 685 neonatal deaths) met inclusion criteria. The distribution of reported causes of death varied substantially between countries and across studies. Based on 193 countries, the major causes of neonatal death globally were estimated to be infections (sepsis/pneumonia, tetanus, and diarrhoea, 35\%), preterm birth (28\%), and asphyxia (23\%). Regional variation is important. Substantial uncertainty surrounds these {estimates.Conclusions} This exercise highlights the lack of reliable cause-of-death data in the settings in which most neonatal deaths occur.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
There are no large population-based studies on occupational asthma, and few estimates of the proportion of asthma attributed to occupation, even though asthma is the most common occupational respiratory disorder in industrialised countries.
Methods
We assessed data on 15637 people aged 20–44, randomly selected from the general population of 26 areas in 12 industrialised countries. Asthma was assessed by methacholine challenge test and by questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms and use of medication. Occupation was defined by job-titles and a job exposure matrix was constructed.
Findings
Highest risk of asthma, defined as bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reported asthma symptoms or medication, was shown for farmers (odds ratio 2·62 [95\% {CI} 1·29–5·35]), painters (2·34 [1·04–5·28]), plastic workers (2·20 [0·59–8·29]), cleaners (1·97 [1·33–2·92]), spray painters (1·96 [0·72–5·34]), and agricultural workers (1·79 [1·02–3·16]). Similar risks were shown for asthma defined as reported asthma symptoms or medication. The most consistent results across countries were shown for farmers and cleaners. Excess asthma risk was associated with high exposure to biological dusts, mineral dusts, and gases and fumes. The proportion of asthma among young adults attributed to occupation was 5\%–10\%.
Interpretation
The prevalence of occupational asthma in women and in specific occupations has been underestimated. Given a mean prevalence of asthma of about 5\%, about 0·2\%–0·5\% of young adults become asthmatics or have their asthma exacerbated because of their occupations.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease {(COPD)} is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and accurate estimates of the prevalence of this disease are needed to anticipate the future burden of {COPD}, target key risk factors, and plan for providing {COPD-related} health services. We aimed to measure the prevalence of {COPD} and its risk factors and investigate variation across countries by age, sex, and smoking status.
Methods
Participants from 12 sites (n=9425) completed postbronchodilator spirometry testing plus questionnaires about respiratory symptoms, health status, and exposure to {COPD} risk factors. {COPD} prevalence estimates based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease staging criteria were adjusted for the target population. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios {(ORs)} for {COPD} associated with 10-year age increments and 10-pack-year (defined as the number of cigarettes smoked per day divided by 20 and multiplied by the number of years that the participant smoked) increments. Meta-analyses provided pooled estimates for these risk factors.
Findings
The prevalence of stage {II} or higher {COPD} was 10·1\% {(SE} 4·8) overall, 11·8\% (7·9) for men, and 8·5\% (5·8) for women. The {ORs} for 10-year age increments were much the same across sites and for women and men. The overall pooled estimate was 1·94 (95\% {CI} 1·80–2·10) per 10-year increment. Site-specific pack-year {ORs} varied significantly in women (pooled {OR=1·28}, 95\% {CI} 1·15–1·42, p=0·012), but not in men (1·16, 1·12–1·21, p=0·743).
Interpretation
This worldwide study showed higher levels and more advanced staging of spirometrically confirmed {COPD} than have typically been reported. However, although age and smoking are strong contributors to {COPD}, they do not fully explain variations in disease prevalence—other factors also seem to be important. Although smoking cessation is becoming an increasingly urgent objective for an ageing worldwide population, a better understanding of other factors that contribute to {COPD} is crucial to assist local public-health officials in developing the best possible primary and secondary prevention policies for their regions.},

	abstract = {Summary
The three main soil-transmitted helminth infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm, are common clinical disorders in man. The gastrointestinal tract of a child living in poverty in a less developed country is likely to be parasitised with at least one, and in many cases all three soil-transmitted helminths, with resultant impairments in physical, intellectual, and cognitive development. The benzimidazole anthelmintics, mebendazole and albendazole, are commonly used to remove these infections. The use of these drugs is not limited to treatment of symptomatic soil-transmitted helminth infections, but also for large-scale prevention of morbidity in children living in endemic areas. As a result of data showing improvements in child health and education after deworming, and the burden of disease attributed to soil-transmitted helminths, the worldwide community is awakening to the importance of these infections. Concerns about the sustainability of periodic deworming with benzimidazole anthelmintics and the emergence of resistance have prompted efforts to develop and test new control tools.},

Calculation of rank was embodied in the Dundee coronary risk-disk; the formula was tested against the Whitehall study; disk and action plan were evaluated in primary care. {RESULTS--The} system measures modifiable coronary risk from smoking, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol concentration by a sex and age related rank running from 1 (high risk, priority action) to 100 (low risk, general advice). The formula predicted outcome acceptably in the Whitehall study and is built into a circular slide rule. Only eight (11\%) of 76 general practitioners and practice nurses surveyed already used risk factor scores. After evaluation most thought they should use one and proposed to incorporate the Dundee coronary risk-disk and the associated action plan into their routines. {CONCLUSION--The} Dundee coronary risk-disk readout of Dundee rank, standardised on a scale of 1 to 100 by age and sex, is a simple, valid means of assessing and monitoring modifiable coronary risk. It puts single risk factors (such as cholesterol concentration) in perspective and can aid selective testing. Understood by medical staff and patients, it should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the high risk approach to coronary prevention.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Excess bodyweight is a major public health concern. However, few worldwide comparative analyses of long-term trends of body-mass index {(BMI)} have been done, and none have used recent national health examination surveys. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean {BMI.}


{METHODS}

We estimated trends and their uncertainties of mean {BMI} for adults 20 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (960 country-years and 9·1 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {BMI} by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.


{FINDINGS}

Between 1980 and 2008, mean {BMI} worldwide increased by 0·4 kg/m(2) per decade (95\% uncertainty interval 0·2-0·6, posterior probability of being a true increase {\textgreater}0·999) for men and 0·5 kg/m(2) per decade (0·3-0·7, posterior probability {\textgreater}0·999) for women. National {BMI} change for women ranged from non-significant decreases in 19 countries to increases of more than 2·0 kg/m(2) per decade (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·99) in nine countries in Oceania. Male {BMI} increased in all but eight countries, by more than 2 kg/m(2) per decade in Nauru and Cook Islands (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·999). Male and female {BMIs} in 2008 were highest in some Oceania countries, reaching 33·9 kg/m(2) (32·8-35·0) for men and 35·0 kg/m(2) (33·6-36·3) for women in Nauru. Female {BMI} was lowest in Bangladesh (20·5 kg/m(2), 19·8-21·3) and male {BMI} in Democratic Republic of the Congo 19·9 kg/m(2) (18·2-21·5), with {BMI} less than 21·5 kg/m(2) for both sexes in a few countries in {sub-Saharan} Africa, and east, south, and southeast Asia. The {USA} had the highest {BMI} of high-income countries. In 2008, an estimated 1·46 billion adults (1·41-1·51 billion) worldwide had {BMI} of 25 kg/m(2) or greater, of these 205 million men (193-217 million) and 297 million women (280-315 million) were obese.


{INTERPRETATION}

Globally, mean {BMI} has increased since 1980. The trends since 1980, and mean population {BMI} in 2008, varied substantially between nations. Interventions and policies that can curb or reverse the increase, and mitigate the health effects of high {BMI} by targeting its metabolic mediators, are needed in most countries.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Child survival efforts can be effective only if they are based on accurate information about causes of deaths. Here, we report on a 4-year effort by {WHO} to improve the accuracy of this information.
Methods
{WHO} established the external Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group {(CHERG)} in 2001 to develop estimates of the proportion of deaths in children younger than age 5 years attributable to pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles, and the major causes of death in the first 28 days of life. Various methods, including single-cause and multi-cause proportionate mortality models, were used. The role of undernutrition as an underlying cause of death was estimated in collaboration with {CHERG.}
Findings
In 2000–03, six causes accounted for 73\% of the 10.6 million yearly deaths in children younger than age 5 years: pneumonia (19\%), diarrhoea (18\%), malaria (8\%), neonatal pneumonia or sepsis (10\%), preterm delivery (10\%), and asphyxia at birth (8\%). The four communicable disease categories account for more than half (54\%) of all child deaths. The greatest communicable disease killers are similar in all {WHO} regions with the exception of malaria; 94\% of global deaths attributable to this disease occur in the Africa region. Undernutrition is an underlying cause of 53\% of all deaths in children younger than age 5 years.
Interpretation
Achievement of the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds from the 1990 rate will depend on renewed efforts to prevent and control pneumonia, diarrhoea, and undernutrition in all {WHO} regions, and malaria in the Africa region. In all regions, deaths in the neonatal period, primarily due to preterm delivery, sepsis or pneumonia, and birth asphyxia should also be addressed. These estimates of the causes of child deaths should be used to guide public-health policies and programmes.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death in the western world and 1 of the leading causes of death worldwide. The lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease {(CVD)} for persons at age 50 years, on average, is estimated to be 52\% for men and 39\% for women, with a wide variation depending on risk factor burden. Assessing patients' cardiovascular risk may be used for the targeting of preventive treatments of individual patients who are asymptomatic but at sufficiently high risk for the development of {CVD.} Risk stratifying patients for {CVD} remains challenging, particularly for those with low or intermediate short-term risk. Several algorithms have been described to facilitate the assessment of risk in individual patients. We describe 6 risk algorithms {(Framingham} Risk Score for coronary heart disease events and for cardiovascular events, Adult Treatment Panel {III}, {SCORE} {[Systematic} Coronary Risk Evaluation] project, Reynolds Risk Score, {ASSIGN} {[Assessing} Cardiovascular Risk to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines {Network/SIGN} to Assign Preventative Treatment], and {QRISK} {[QRESEARCH} Cardiovascular Risk Algorithm]) for outcomes, population derived/validated, receiver-operating characteristic, variables included, and limitations. Areas of uncertainty include 10-year versus lifetime risk, prediction of {CVD} or coronary heart disease end points, nonlaboratory-based risk scores, age at which to start, race and sex differences, and whether a risk score should guide therapy. We believe that the best high-risk approach to {CVD} evaluation and prevention lies in routine testing for cardiovascular risk factors and risk score assessment. We recommend that health care providers discuss the global cardiovascular risk and lifetime cardiovascular risk score assessment with each patient to better explain each patient's future risk. Appropriate intervention, guided by risk assessment, has the potential to bring about a significant reduction in population levels of risk.},

However, few countries in Africa have implemented {SHI.} Despite the sustained interest in {SHI}, there are growing concerns about whether it will achieve equity and financial sustainability objectives. It is clear that the design of {SHI} is of critical importance in this regard. South Africa has debated whether or not to implement {SHI} for nearly a decade and a half, and the design of {SHI} proposals has changed dramatically over that period. This paper considers lessons that can be drawn from the South African experience of developing and adapting {SHI} design, in conjunction with recent evidence from other low- and middle-income countries. The paper illustrates how {SHI} design may be affected by the trade-offs that are made to accommodate key actors’ views, an accommodation that may even undermine the achievement of key objectives. A critical design requirement to promote equity and sustainability is a common contribution and risk pool across the {SHI} and any existing private insurers. In addition, given the complexity of {SHI} reforms, and the fact that {SHI} is usually only one component of a broader package of health sector reforms, the appropriate sequencing of implementation of the {SHI} and associated, supporting organizational and financing reforms is essential. As {SHI} evolves within a country, it is important to benchmark the changing nature of its design against pre-determined objectives in order to protect the final integrity of the policy.},

This is the second of five papers in the child survival series. The first focused on continuing high rates of child mortality (over 10 million each year) from preventable causes: diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, {HIV/AIDS}, the underlying cause of undernutrition, and a small group of causes leading to neonatal deaths. We review child survival interventions feasible for delivery at high coverage in low-income settings, and classify these as level 1 (sufficient evidence of effect), level 2 (limited evidence), or level 3 (inadequate evidence). Our results show that at least one level-1 intervention is available for preventing or treating each main cause of death among children younger than 5 years, apart from birth asphyxia, for which a level-2 intervention is available. There is also limited evidence for several other interventions. However, global coverage for most interventions is below 50\%. If level 1 or 2 interventions were universally available, 63\% of child deaths could be prevented. These findings show that the interventions needed to achieve the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds by 2015 are available, but that they are not being delivered to the mothers and children who need them.},

	abstract = {Sex differences in asthma prevalence and morbidity, assessed with different methods in different populations, have raised several hypotheses about the different susceptibility to asthma in men and women. However, information on the incidence of asthma by age and sex is limited. The aim of this study was to estimate the age- and sex-specific incidence of asthma from birth to 44 yr of age in men and women across several countries, and to evaluate the main factors influencing asthma incidence in young adults. The data of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, an international, cross-sectional, population-based survey, which were collected in 16 countries from 1991 to 1993 according to a common protocol, and which pertained to 18,659 subjects, were analyzed retrospectively, using the reported age of the first attack as the onset of asthma. During childhood, girls had a significantly lower risk of developing asthma than did boys (relative risk {[RR]:} 0.74 and 0.56 in the 0- to 5-yr and 5- to 10-yr age classes, respectively). Around puberty, the risk was almost equal in the two sexes {(RR} = 0.84; 95\% confidence interval {[CI]:} 0.65 to 1.10 in the 10 to 15-yr age class). After puberty, the risk in women was always significantly higher than that in men {(RR:} 1.38 to 5.91). This pattern was consistent in all of the 16 countries studied, and was not influenced by recall or cohort effects. When the effects of airway caliber and smoking were studied with a case-control design, the results showed that women's greater susceptibility to asthma in early adulthood was at least partly, explained by their smaller airway caliber (the {OR} decreased from 2.04 [95\% {CI:} 1.32 to 3.15] to 1.47 [95\% {CI:} 0.89 to 2.44] after controlling for height-adjusted {FEV1);} while smoking did not increase the risk. This analysis strongly confirms that the incidence of asthma shows a sex reversal during puberty, and suggests that airway caliber, in addition to hormonal factors, could play an important role in explaining the different patterns of asthma incidence in men and women.},

The need for timely and reliable information about global health resource flows to low-income and middle-income countries is widely recognised. We aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of development assistance for health {(DAH)} from 1990 to {2007.Methods}
We defined {DAH} as all flows for health from public and private institutions whose primary purpose is to provide development assistance to low-income and middle-income countries. We used several data sources to measure the yearly volume of {DAH} in 2007 {US\$}, and created an integrated project database to examine the composition of this assistance by recipient {country.Findings}
{DAH} grew from \$5·6 billion in 1990 to \$21·8 billion in 2007. The proportion of {DAH} channelled via {UN} agencies and development banks decreased from 1990 to 2007, whereas the Global Fund to Fight {AIDS}, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization {(GAVI)}, and non-governmental organisations became the conduit for an increasing share of {DAH.} {DAH} has risen sharply since 2002 because of increases in public funding, especially from the {USA}, and on the private side, from increased philanthropic donations and in-kind contributions from corporate donors. Of the \$14·5 billion {DAH} in 2007 for which project-level information was available, \$5·1 billion was for {HIV/AIDS}, compared with \$0·7 billion for tuberculosis, \$0·8 billion for malaria, and \$0·9 billion for health-sector support. Total {DAH} received by low-income and middle-income countries was positively correlated with burden of disease, whereas per head {DAH} was negatively correlated with per head gross domestic {product.Interpretation}
This study documents the substantial rise of resources for global health in recent years. Although the rise in {DAH} has resulted in increased funds for {HIV/AIDS}, other areas of global health have also expanded. The influx of funds has been accompanied by major changes in the institutional landscape of global health, with global health initiatives such as the Global Fund and {GAVI} having a central role in mobilising and channelling global health {funds.Funding}

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Global coronary heart disease {(CHD)} risk estimation (ie, a quantitative estimate of a patient's chances of {CHD} calculated by combining risk factors in an empirical equation) is recommended as a starting point for primary prevention efforts in all {US} adults. Whether it improves outcomes is currently unknown.


{METHODS}

To assess the effect of providing global {CHD} risk information to adults, we performed a systematic evidence review. We searched {MEDLINE} for the years 1980 to 2008, Psych Info, {CINAHL}, and the Cochrane Database and included English-language articles that met prespecified inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles for inclusion and assessed study quality.


{RESULTS}

We identified 20 articles, reporting on 18 unique fair or good quality studies (including 14 randomized controlled studies). These showed that global {CHD} risk information alone or with accompanying education increased the accuracy of perceived risk and probably increased intent to start therapy. Studies with repeated risk information or risk information and repeated doses of counseling showed small significant reductions in predicted {CHD} risk (absolute differences, -0.2\% to -2\% over 10 years in studies using risk estimates derived from Framingham equations). Studies providing global risk information at only 1 point in time seemed ineffective.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Global {CHD} risk information seems to improve the accuracy of risk perception and may increase intent to initiate {CHD} prevention among individuals at moderate to high risk. The effect of global risk presentation on more distal outcomes is less clear and seems to be related to the intensity of accompanying interventions.},

This paper explores the possible application of these notions within the context of South Africa, a country in which inequities in income and social service distribution between ‘racial’ groups were systematically promoted and entrenched during four decades of minority rule, guided by apartheid and related policies. With the transition to a democratic government in 1994, equity gained prominence on the South African social policy agenda. Health equity has been awarded a particularly high priority, not least of all because the health sector is seen as vehicle for achieving rapid equity gains. In addition, many of the other equity-promoting social sector policies (such as improved access to housing and water and sanitation services) have been motivated on the basis of their potential health equity gains. The South African experience since 1994 provides useful insights into factors which may facilitate or constrain health equity progress. In particular, the constitutional entitlement to health and civil society action to maintain health equity's place on the social policy agenda are seen as important facilitating factors. Certain health sector programmes have also been developed which are intended preferentially to benefit those who have been historically dis-advantaged, and which thus support vertical equity goals. However, there have been no efforts to promote cross-subsidisation between the private and public health sectors, and initial efforts to promote coherency in social policies (through the Reconstruction and Development Programme) appear not to have been sustained. In addition, macro-economic policies (particularly the highly ambitious budget deficit reduction targets of the government) are likely to undermine some of the equity-promoting social policy initiatives. Most importantly, the potential inter-relationship of vertical equity and procedural justice goals has not been adequately recognised. As a result, and despite policy rhetoric, this paper concludes that health equity goals are critically dependent on the central involvement of the dis-advantaged in decision-making about who should receive priority, what services should be delivered and how equity-promoting initiatives should be implemented.},

The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5\% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8\% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease from the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and from breast and colorectal cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women has leveled off after increasing for many decades. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40\% and 20\% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Maternal mortality, as a largely avoidable cause of death, is an important focus of international development efforts, and a target for Millennium Development Goal {(MDG)} 5. However, data weaknesses have made monitoring progress problematic. In 2006, a new maternal mortality working group was established to develop improved estimation methods and make new estimates of maternal mortality for 2005, and to analyse trends in maternal mortality since {1990.Methods}
We developed and used a range of methods, depending on the type of data available, to produce comparable country, regional, and global estimates of maternal mortality ratios for 2005 and to assess trends between 1990 and {2005.Findings}
We estimate that there were 535[punctuation space]900 maternal deaths in 2005, corresponding to a maternal mortality ratio of 402 (uncertainty bounds 216-654) deaths per 100[punctuation space]000 livebirths. Most maternal deaths in 2005 were concentrated in {sub-Saharan} Africa (270[punctuation space]500, 50\%) and Asia (240[punctuation space]600, 45\%). For all countries with data, there was a decrease of 2·5\% per year in the maternal mortality ratio between 1990 and 2005 (p{\textless}0·0001); however, there was no evidence of a significant reduction in maternal mortality ratios in {sub-Saharan} Africa in the same {period.Interpretation}
Although some regions have shown some progress since 1990 in reducing maternal deaths, maternal mortality ratios in {sub-Saharan} Africa have remained very high, with little evidence of improvement in the past 15 years. To achieve {MDG5} targets by 2015 will require sustained and urgent emphasis on improved pregnancy and delivery care throughout the developing world.},

National census and survey estimates, vital registration data from Harare and Bulawayo, and prospective local population survey data from eastern Zimbabwe showed substantial rises in mortality during the 1990s levelling off after 2000. Direct estimates of {HIV} incidence in male factory workers and women attending pre- and post-natal clinics, trends in {HIV} prevalence in 15–24-year-olds, and back-calculation estimates based on the vital registration data from Harare indicated that {HIV} incidence may have peaked in the early 1990s and fallen during the 1990s. Household survey data showed reductions in numbers reporting casual partners from the late 1990s and high condom use in non-regular partnerships between 1998 and {2007.Conclusions} These findings provide the first convincing evidence of an {HIV} decline accelerated by changes in sexual behaviour in a southern African country.

In order to move to continuous surveillance, maternal deaths were made a Class 1 notifiable event in 1998. Reporting has steadily improved with over 80\% of deaths notified, however events in the first trimester and after the first week post-partum were less likely to be reported. While gestational hypertension remains the leading cause of death, the cause-specific mortality rate has declined in response to specific efforts to reduce its prevalence and consequences. Haemorrhage and infection also declined significantly in prevalence and rank. {HIV} disease moved rapidly to become the fourth-ranked cause of maternal death. Another lifestyle problem is the growing prevalence of obesity, with its contribution to deaths from heart disease, diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension. A national maternal mortality surveillance committee has been established to monitor national trends and address policy issues. One of its first tasks will be to develop clinical guidelines to standardize management of the leading direct and indirect complications of pregnancy. {CONCLUSION} Jamaica has the capacity to achieve {MDG5}, however local and national maternal mortality committees and health teams will have to systematically address the deficiencies identified.},

Yet learning often fails even when strong evidence is available: common mental models lead to erroneous but self-confirming inferences, allowing harmful beliefs and behaviors to persist and undermining implementation of beneficial policies.

Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2005 decreased by 11.4\%, with decreases in breast (37\%) and colorectal (24\%) cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates has resulted in the avoidance of about 650,000 deaths from cancer over the 15-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years of age. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. {CA} Cancer J Clin 2009;59:225-249. ? 2009 American Cancer Society, Inc.},

	abstract = {Summary
Despite having achieved an average life expectancy of 75 years, much the same as that of more developed countries, Mexico entered the 21st century with a health system marred by its failure to offer financial protection in health to more than half of its citizens; this was both a result and a cause of the social inequalities that have marked the development process in Mexico. Several structural limitations have hampered performance and limited the progress of the health system. Conscious that the lack of financial protection was the major bottleneck, Mexico has embarked on a structural reform to improve health system performance by establishing the System of Social Protection in Health {(SSPH)}, which has introduced new financial rules and incentives. The main innovation of the reform has been the Seguro Popular {(Popular} Health Insurance), the insurance-based component of the {SSPH}, aimed at funding health care for all those families, most of them poor, who had been previously excluded from social health insurance. The reform has allowed for a substantial increase in public investment in health while realigning incentives towards better technical and interpersonal quality. This paper describes the main features and initial results of the Mexican reform effort, and derives lessons for other countries considering health-system transformations under similarly challenging circumstances.},

Global estimates for asphyxia-related neonatal deaths vary from 0.7 to 1.2 million. Estimates for intrapartum stillbirths are not available. We aimed to estimate the numbers of intrapartum-related neonatal deaths and intrapartum stillbirths in the year 2000. {METHODS:} Sources of data on neonatal death included: vital registration {(VR)} data on neonatal death from countries with full ({\textgreater} 90\%) {VR} coverage (48 countries, n = 97,297); studies identified through literature searches ({\textgreater} 4000 abstracts) and meeting inclusion criteria (46 populations, 30 countries, n = 12,355). A regression model was fitted to cause-specific proportionate mortality data from {VR} and the literature. Predicted cause-specific proportions were applied to the number of neonatal deaths by country, and summed to a global total. Intrapartum stillbirths were estimated using median cause-specific mortality rate by country (73 populations, 52 countries, n = 46,779) or the subregional median in the absence of country data. {FINDINGS:} Intrapartum-related neonatal deaths were estimated at 0.904 million (uncertainty 0.65-1.17), equivalent to 23\% of the global total of 4 million neonatal deaths. Country-level model predictions compared well with population-based data sets not included in the input data. An estimated 1.02 million intrapartum stillbirths (0.66-1.48 million) occur annually, comprising 26\% of global stillbirths. {CONCLUSION:} Intrapartum-related neonatal deaths account for almost 10\% of deaths in children aged under 5 years. Intrapartum stillbirths are a huge and invisible problem, but are potentially preventable. Programmatic attention and improved information are required.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}

The {SCORE} project was initiated to develop a risk scoring system for use in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical practice.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12 European cohort studies, mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 20,5178 persons (88,080 women and 11,7098 men) representing 2.7 million person years of follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure of exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and for non-coronary cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk and low-risk regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were developed, one based on total cholesterol and the other on total {cholesterol/HDL} cholesterol ratio. The risk estimations are displayed graphically in simple risk charts. Predictive value of the risk charts was examined by applying them to persons aged 45-64; areas under {ROC} curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.84.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The {SCORE} risk estimation system offers direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk in a format suited to the constraints of clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous literature has indicated that environmental exposures in childhood influence development of atopic sensitization. Objective: We sought to study the association between childhood environment and adult atopy. Methods: Thirteen thousand nine hundred thirty-two subjects aged 20 to 44 years from 36 areas in Europe, New Zealand, the United States, and Australia took part in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, answering interviewer-led questionnaires and providing blood tests for measurement of specific {IgE} to grass, house dust mite, cat, and Cladosporium allergens. Results: Atopy was negatively associated with family size {(OR} = 0.93; 95\% {CI} = 0.90-0.96 per 1 sib), partly attributable to an independent protective effect of a greater number of brothers {(OR} = 0.92; 95\% {CI} = 0.89-0.95 per 1 brother). Accounting for total number of siblings, no further influence was detected for number of older or younger siblings. Bedroom sharing was associated with a lower prevalence of atopy, particularly to cat allergen. A protective effect of family size and bedroom sharing could only be detected in subjects reporting no parental allergy (family size, test for interaction P = .012). The presence of a dog in the home in childhood was negatively associated with adult atopy {(OR} = 0.85, 95\% {CI} = 0.78-0.92), an effect that remained after adjustment for parental allergy, sibling allergy, and adult pet ownership. Conclusion: Subjects from large families with brothers, shared bedrooms, and dogs in childhood were less often atopic as adults. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infectious agents could inhibit development of atopy during childhood. However, in subjects with a strong genetic predisposition, environmental factors in childhood are possibly of less importance. {(J} Allergy Clin Immunol 1999;103:415-20.)},

	abstract = {Intestinal nematode infections are recognized as a major public health problem, and helminth control is currently being directed towards school-aged children who are known to harbour the heaviest infections and are most likely to suffer from associated morbidity. However, few data are available for the epidemiology of intestinal nematodes in pre-school children in Africa, and the contribution of hookworm infection to the aetiology and severity of anaemia among pre-school children remains poorly understood. This paper investigates the epidemiology of parasitic infections in 460 pre-school children who were part of a larger case-control study of severe malaria in Kilifi on the Kenyan coast. Almost one-third (28·7\%) were infected with hookworm, 20·2\% with Ascaris lumbricoides and 15·0\% with Trichuris trichiura. Infection prevalence of each species rose with age, and the prevalence of heavy infection with hookworm and mean intensity of hookworm were markedly age-dependent. One-third (34·3\%) of children had malaria. Overall, 76·3\% of children were anaemic (haemoglobin \&lt; 110 {g/L)}, with the prevalence decreasing with age. Anaemia was significantly worst in children with heavy hookworm infection (\&gt;200 eggs per gram). This relationship held for all ages, both sexes, and was independent of socioeconomic factors. The application of attributable morbidity methods confirmed the contribution of hookworm infection to anaemia.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the processes of policy-making, budgeting and service implementation in three provinces of South Africa, drawing on interviews with health managers at different levels of government. It illustrates how the process of decentralisation creates disjunctures between the policy-making authority of higher levels of government and the implementation capacity of service provision levels. It also explores the complex dynamics between those responsible for specific policies, such as reproductive health policies, and those responsible for managing the integrated delivery of all policies, with their resultant contestations over authority and resources. The pace of change in South Africa and the enormous capacity it requires, both in relation to financial management and the technical skills needed for specific programmes, has created a sense of frustration and demoralisation. Whilst shortage of financial resources, particularly as reflected in shortage of staff, is frequently assumed to be the biggest constraint in this context, most managers identified other issues, particularly staff morale, as greater barriers to the delivery of high quality health services. The paper concludes that it is the complexity of experience and feelings described by health managers that may determine the extent and quality of service delivery. For this reason, both practice and research need to give greater attention to issues of power relations and personal experience of change.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence shows that social relationships play an important role in health and health behavior. We examined the relationship between social networks and cancer screening among four {U.S.} Hispanic groups.

Methods: We used telephone surveys to collect data in eight {U.S.} regions that have concentrations of diverse Hispanic-origin populations. We interviewed 8903 Hispanic adults, for a response rate of 83\%; analysis was restricted to the 2383 women aged ≥40. As a measure of social integration, we formed a social network index from items on the number of close relatives and friends, frequency of contact, and church membership. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of social integration on screening, adjusting for sociodemographic factors.

Results: Among Mexican, Cuban, and {Central-American} women, the effect of social integration on mammography screening was slight. The odds ratios {(OR)} per unit change in social integration category ranged from 1.16 to 1.22 with confidence intervals {(CI)} that overlapped with the null. For Pap smear screening, the effect was strongest among {Mexican-American} women {(OR=1.44}, 95\% {CI=1.21} to 1.72), but also evident among {Central-American} women {(OR=1.22}, 95\% {CI=0.72} to 2.06) and Cuban women {(OR} = 1.25, 95\% {CI} = 0.81 to 1.93). Among Puerto Rican women, social integration had no effect on either mammography {(OR=1.03)} or Pap smear screening {(OR=1.08).}

Conclusions: Independent of socioeconomic factors, social integration appears to influence cancer screening participation of Hispanic women. The modest effect is not universal across Hispanic groups and was stronger for Pap smear than for mammography screening behavior. Researchers should recognize Hispanic group differences in social network characteristics and the potential of social networks to change screening behavior.},

The fall in direct mortality (p=0.0003) included 24\% fewer hypertension deaths (introduction of clinical guidelines, reorganization of antenatal services) and 36\% fewer hemorrhage deaths (introduction of plasma expanders). These improvements were tempered by growing indirect mortality (p=0.057), moving to 31\% of maternal deaths from 17\% in 1993-95. {INTERPRETATION} Declines in direct mortality may be associated with surveillance and related improvements in obstetric care.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Comparisons among countries can help to identify opportunities for the reduction of inequalities in health. We compared the magnitude of inequalities in mortality and self-assessed health among 22 countries in all parts of Europe.


{METHODS}

We obtained data on mortality according to education level and occupational class from census-based mortality studies. Deaths were classified according to cause, including common causes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer; causes related to smoking; causes related to alcohol use; and causes amenable to medical intervention, such as tuberculosis and hypertension. Data on self-assessed health, smoking, and obesity according to education and income were obtained from health or multipurpose surveys. For each country, the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes was measured with the use of regression-based inequality indexes.


{RESULTS}

In almost all countries, the rates of death and poorer self-assessments of health were substantially higher in groups of lower socioeconomic status, but the magnitude of the inequalities between groups of higher and lower socioeconomic status was much larger in some countries than in others. Inequalities in mortality were small in some southern European countries and very large in most countries in the eastern and Baltic regions. These variations among countries appeared to be attributable in part to causes of death related to smoking or alcohol use or amenable to medical intervention. The magnitude of inequalities in self-assessed health also varied substantially among countries, but in a different pattern.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We observed variation across Europe in the magnitude of inequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status. These inequalities might be reduced by improving educational opportunities, income distribution, health-related behavior, or access to health care.},

From April to August 2007, in Mexico, a {GCEA} of the interventions was developed for 10 possible scenarios using a Markov model from the public sector perspective as payer.


{RESULTS}

Scenarios considering 80\% coverage show an {ACER} per {DALY} averted of \$16678 pesos for Pap of women between ages 25 and 64, \$17277 pesos for {HC} of women between ages 30 and 64, and \$84008 pesos for vaccination of 12-year-old girls. Annual financing of \$621, \$741 and \$2255 million pesos, respectively, is needed for these scenarios.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A selective, combined introduction of {Pap-HC} screening that considers the comparative advantages of application in different populations and geographical areas is suggested. Additionally, it is suggested to introduce the vaccine once a threshold price of \$181 pesos per dose -when the vaccine becomes equal in terms of cost-effectiveness to {HC-} has been achieved.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

The major objective of this study is to provide estimates of diarrhoea mortality at country, regional and global level by employing the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group {(CHERG)} standard.


{METHODS}

A systematic and comprehensive literature review was undertaken of all studies published since 1980 reporting under-5 diarrhoea mortality. Information was collected on characteristics of each study and its population. A regression model was used to relate these characteristics to proportional mortality from diarrhoea and to predict its distribution in national populations.


{FINDINGS}

Global deaths from diarrhoea of children aged less than 5 years were estimated at 1.87 million (95\% confidence interval, {CI:} 1.56-2.19), approximately 19\% of total child deaths. {WHO} African and {South-East} Asia Regions combined contain 78\% (1.46 million) of all diarrhoea deaths occurring among children in the developing world; 73\% of these deaths are concentrated in just 15 developing countries.


{CONCLUSION}

Planning and evaluation of interventions to control diarrhoea deaths and to reduce under-5 mortality is obstructed by the lack of a system that regularly generates cause-of-death information. The methods used here provide country-level estimates that constitute alternative information for planning in settings without adequate data.},

	abstract = {Summary
In this second article of the neonatal survival series, we identify 16 interventions with proven efficacy (implementation under ideal conditions) for neonatal survival and combine them into packages for scaling up in health systems, according to three service delivery modes (outreach, family-community, and facility-based clinical care). All the packages of care are cost effective compared with single interventions. Universal (99\%) coverage of these interventions could avert an estimated 41–72\% of neonatal deaths worldwide. At 90\% coverage, intrapartum and postnatal packages have similar effects on neonatal mortality—two-fold to three-fold greater than that of antenatal care. However, running costs are two-fold higher for intrapartum than for postnatal care. A combination of universal—ie, for all settings—outreach and family-community care at 90\% coverage averts 18–37\% of neonatal deaths. Most of this benefit is derived from family-community care, and greater effect is seen in settings with very high neonatal mortality. Reductions in neonatal mortality that exceed 50\% can be achieved with an integrated, high-coverage programme of universal outreach and family-community care, consisting of 12\% and 26\%, respectively, of total running costs, plus universal facility-based clinical services, which make up 62\% of the total cost. Early success in averting neonatal deaths is possible in settings with high mortality and weak health systems through outreach and family-community care, including health education to improve home-care practices, to create demand for skilled care, and to improve care seeking. Simultaneous expansion of clinical care for babies and mothers is essential to achieve the reduction in neonatal deaths needed to meet the Millennium Development Goal for child survival.

	abstract = {The Thai government has implemented universal coverage of health insurance since October 2001. Universal access to antiretroviral {(ARV)} drugs has also been included since October 2003. These two policies have greatly increased the demand for health services and human resources for health, particularly among public health care {providers.After} the 1997 economic crisis, private health care providers, with the support of the government, embarked on new marketing strategies targeted at attracting foreign patients. Consequently, increasing numbers of foreign patients are visiting Thailand to seek medical care. In addition, the economic recovery since 2001 has greatly increased the demand for private health services among the Thai {population.The} increasing demand and much higher financial incentives from urban private providers have attracted health personnel, particularly medical doctors, from rural public health care facilities. Responding to this increasing demand and internal brain drain, in mid-2004 the Thai government approved the increased production of medical doctors by 10 678 in the following 15 years. Many additional financial incentives have also been applied. However, the immediate shortage of human resources needs to be addressed competently and {urgently.Equity} in health care access under this situation of competing demands from dual track policies is a challenge to policy makers and analysts. This paper summarizes the situation and trends as well as the responses by the Thai government. Both supply and demand side responses are described, and some solutions to restore equity in health care access are proposed.},

Although both approaches are based on similar sets of empirical country data, their statistical methods differ in important respects--with implications for the resulting global, regional and country estimates. This paper examines the differences, discusses both the value and inherent limitations in such exercises, proposes ways of interpreting the different estimates and suggests how such exercises could be made more relevant to the needs of country-level decision-makers. It calls on the global community to invest seriously in working with countries to generate primary data on maternal mortality using measurement methods that reduce uncertainty and generate data on a continuing basis. The best routine source of data on maternal deaths is a civil registration system that assures permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events, including births and deaths, and causes of death. The record of deaths among women of reproductive age derived from civil registration is often the first step in conducting a confidential enquiry into and preventing maternal deaths.},

Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality include stabilization of incidence rates for all cancer sites combined in men from 1995 through 2004 and in women from 1999 through 2004 and a continued decrease in the cancer death rate since 1990 in men and since 1991 in women. Overall cancer death rates in 2004 compared with 1990 in men and 1991 in women decreased by 18.4\% and 10.5\%, respectively, resulting in the avoidance of over a half million deaths from cancer during this time interval. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. Although much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates, stabilizing incidence rates, and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

Yet learning often fails even when strong evidence is available: common mental models lead to erroneous but self-confirming inferences, allowing harmful beliefs and behaviors to persist and undermining implementation of beneficial policies.

The economic costs of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs to Canadian society in 1992 are estimated utilizing a cost-of-illness framework and recently developed international guidelines. Measurements. For causes of disease or death (using {ICD-9} categories), pooled relative risk estimates from meta-analyses are combined with prevalence data by age, gender and province to derive the proportion attributable to alcohol, tobacco and/or illicit drugs. The resulting estimates of attributable deaths and hospitalizations are used to calculate associated health care, law enforcement, productivity and other costs. The results are compared with other studies, and sensitivity analyses are conducted on alternative measures of alcohol consumption, alternative discount rates for productivity costs and the use of diagnostic-specific hospitalization costs. Findings. The misuse of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs cost more than \$18.4 billion in Canada in 1992, representing \$649 per capita or 2.7\% of {GDP.} Alcohol accounts for approximately \$7.52 billion in costs, including \$4.14 billion for lost productivity, \$1.36 billion for law enforcement and \$1.30 billion in direct health care costs. Tobacco accounts for approximately \$9.56 billion in costs, including \$6.82 billion for lost productivity and \$2.68 billion for direct health care costs. The economic costs of illicit drugs are estimated at \$1.4 billion. Conclusions. Substance abuse exacts a considerable toll to Canadian society in terms of illness, injury, death and economic costs.},

The global community is in the midst of a growing response to health crises in developing countries, which is focused on mobilising financial resources and increasing access to essential medicines. However, the response has yet to tackle the most important aspect of health-care systems—the people that make them work. Human resources for health—the personnel that deliver public-health, clinical, and environmental services—are in disarray and decline in much of the developing world, particularly in {sub-Saharan} Africa. The reasons behind this disorder are complex. For decades, efforts have focused on building training institutions. What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that issues of supply, demand, and mobility (transnational, regional, and local) are central to the human-resource problem. Without substantial improvements in workforces, newly mobilised funds and commodities will not deliver on their promise. The global community needs to engage in four core strategies: raise the profile of the issue of human resources; improve the conceptual base and statistical evidence available to decision makers; collect, share, and learn from country experiences; and begin to formulate and enact policies at the country level that affect all aspects of the crisis.},

Data collected through telephone surveys were analyzed for women 40 years of age and older (n = 2082). After controlling for demographic variables traditionally related to breast cancer screening rates, it was found that ethno-regional differences in breast cancer screening practices clearly persisted. In addition to traditional demographic factors, other variables evidently underlie differences in Hispanics' utilization of breast cancer screening services.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Studies of socioeconomic disparities in patterns of cause of death have been limited to single countries, middle-aged people, men, or broad cause of death groups. We assessed contribution of specific causes of death to disparities in mortality between groups with different levels of education, in men and women, middle-aged and old, in eight western European populations.
Methods
We analysed data from longitudinal mortality studies by cause of death, between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 1997. Data were included for more than 1 million deaths in 51 million person years of observation.
Findings
Absolute educational inequalities in total mortality peaked at 2127 deaths per 100 000 person years in men, and at 1588 deaths per 100 000 person years in women aged 75 years and older. In this age-group, rate ratios were greater than 1·00 for total mortality and all specific causes of death, apart form prostate cancer in men and lung cancer in women, showing increased mortality in low versus high eductational groups. In men, cardiovascular diseases accounted for 39\% of the difference between low and high eductational groups in total mortality, cancer for 24\%, other diseases for 32\%, and external causes for 5\%. Among women, contributions were 60\%, 11\%, 30\%, and 0\%, respectively. The contributions of cerebrovascular disease, other cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, and {COPD} strongly increased by age, whereas those of cancer and external causes declined. Although relative inequalities in total mortality were closely similar in all populations, we noted striking differences in the contribution of specific causes to these inequalities.
Interpretation
Research needs to be broadened to include older populations, other diseases, and populations from different parts of Europe. Effective interventions should be developed and implemented to reduce exposure to cardiovascular risk factors in low-educational groups.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Newborn deaths account for 57\% of deaths in children younger than 5 years in Pakistan. Although a large programme of trained lady health workers {(LHWs)} exists, the effectiveness of this training on newborn outcomes has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based intervention package, principally delivered through {LHWs} working with traditional birth attendants and community health committees, for reduction of perinatal and neonatal mortality in a rural district of {Pakistan.Methods}
We undertook a cluster randomised trial between February, 2006, and March, 2008, in Hala and Matiari subdistricts, Pakistan. Catchment areas of primary care facilities and all affiliated {LHWs} were used to define clusters, which were allocated to intervention and control groups by restricted, stratified randomisation. The intervention package delivered by {LHWs} through group sessions consisted of promotion of antenatal care and maternal health education, use of clean delivery kits, facility births, immediate newborn care, identification of danger signs, and promotion of careseeking; control clusters received routine care. Independent data collectors undertook quarterly household surveillance to capture data for births, deaths, and household practices related to maternal and newborn care. Data collectors were masked to cluster allocation; those analysing data were not. The primary outcome was perinatal and all-cause neonatal mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, {ISRCTN16247511.Findings}
16 clusters were assigned to intervention (23[punctuation space]353 households, 12[punctuation space]391 total births) and control groups (23[punctuation space]768 households, 11[punctuation space]443 total births). {LHWs} in the intervention clusters were able to undertake 4428 (63\%) of 7084 planned group sessions, but were only able to visit 2943 neonates (24\%) of a total 12[punctuation space]028 livebirths in their catchment villages. Stillbirths were reduced in intervention clusters (39·1 stillbirths per 1000 total births) compared with control (48·7 per 1000; risk ratio {[RR]} 0·79, 95\% {CI} 0·68-0·92; p=0·006). The neonatal mortality rate was 43·0 deaths per 1000 livebirths in intervention clusters compared with 49·1 per 1000 in control groups {(RR} 0·85, 0·76-0·96; {p=0·02).Interpretation}
Our results support the scale-up of preventive and promotive maternal and newborn interventions through community health workers and emphasise the need for attention to issues of programme management and coverage for such initiatives to achieve maximum {potential.Funding}

	abstract = {Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and tumor growth in many experimental systems, but it is unclear which of these tumor models are relevant to humans. We have reported reduced risk of fatal colon cancer among persons who used aspirin in a large prospective study. This analysis examines other fatal cancers in relation to aspirin among 635,031 adults in that study who provided information in 1982 on the frequency and duration of their aspirin use and did not report cancer. Death rates were measured through 1988. Death rates decreased with more frequent aspirin use for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum but not generally for other cancers. For each digestive tract cancer, death rates were approximately 40\% lower among persons who used aspirin 16 times/month or more for at least 1 year compared to those who used no aspirin. The trend of decreasing risk with more frequent aspirin use was strongest among persons who had used aspirin for 10 years or more; it remained statistically significant, except for esophageal cancer, in multivariate analyses that adjusted for other known risk factors. Biases such as early detection or aspirin avoidance among cases do not appear to explain the results. Our data suggest that regular, prolonged use of aspirin may reduce the risk of fatal cancer of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. Future epidemiological and basic research should examine all digestive tract cancers in considering the chemopreventive or therapeutic potential of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Although more than 80\% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown.
Methods
We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins {(Apo)}, and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99\% {CIs} for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks {(PAR)} were calculated.
Findings
Smoking (odds ratio 2·87 for current vs never, {PAR} 35·7\% for current and former vs never), raised {ApoB/ApoA1} ratio (3·25 for top vs lowest quintile, {PAR} 49·2\% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1·91, {PAR} 17·9\%), diabetes (2·37, {PAR} 9·9\%), abdominal obesity (1·12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1·62 for middle vs lowest tertile, {PAR} 20·1\% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2·67, {PAR} 32·5\%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0·70, {PAR} 13·7\% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0·91, {PAR} 6·7\%), and regular physical activity (0·86, {PAR} 12·2\%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p\&lt;0·0001 for all risk factors and p=0·03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90\% of the {PAR} in men and 94\% in women.
Interpretation
Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.

	abstract = {Summary
The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38\% in 2000) is increasing, and the Millennium Development Goal for child survival cannot be met without substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0·5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week—the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99\%) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1\% of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in {sub-Saharan} Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10–15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28\%), severe infections (26\%), and asphyxia (23\%). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7\%), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century.
