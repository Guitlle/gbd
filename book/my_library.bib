	abstract = {Pharmacokinetic {(PK)} models describe how the concentrations of a drug and its metabolite vary with time. Population {PK} models identify and quantify sources of between-individual variability in observed concentrations. Crucial to this aim is the identification of those covariates (i.e., individual-specific characteristics) responsible for explaining the variability. In this article we discuss how covariate modeling can be carried out for population {PK} models. We argue that the importance of a particular covariate can be discussed only with reference to the specific use for which the model is intended. Covariate modeling is important in population {PK} studies as it aids in determining dosage recommendations for specific covariate-defined populations. We describe a Bayesian predictive procedure that places covariate modeling in the context of dosage determination. In problems such as these it is crucial to incorporate relevant prior information. For covariate selection we extend the approach of George and {McCulloch.} The approaches utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methods are illustrated using population {PK} data from a study of the antibiotic vancomycin in babies. These data are sparse, with just 180 concentrations from 37 babies. Eight covariates are available, from which we construct a covariate model.},

	abstract = {Bordetella pertussis infection remains an important public health problem worldwide despite decades of routine vaccination. A key indicator of the impact of vaccination programmes is the inter-epidemic period, which is expected to increase with vaccine uptake if there is significant herd immunity. Based on empirical data from 64 countries across the five continents over the past 30-70 years, we document the observed relationship between the average inter-epidemic period, birth rate and vaccine coverage. We then use a mathematical model to explore the range of scenarios for duration of immunity and transmission resulting from repeat infections that are consistent with empirical evidence. Estimates of pertussis periodicity ranged between 2 and 4.6 years, with a strong association with susceptible recruitment rate, defined as birth rate × (1 - vaccine coverage). Periodicity increased by 1.27 years on average after the introduction of national vaccination programmes (95\% {CI:} 1.13, 1.41 years), indicative of increased herd immunity. Mathematical models suggest that the observed patterns of pertussis periodicity are equally consistent with loss of immunity that is not as rapid as currently thought, or with negligible transmission generated by repeat infections. We conclude that both vaccine coverage and birth rate drive pertussis periodicity globally and that vaccination induces strong herd immunity effects. A better understanding of the role of repeat infections in pertussis transmission is critical to refine existing control strategies.},

Studies were included if they reported relative risks {(RRs)} and corresponding 95\% confidence interval {(CI)} of {CHD} with respect to frequency of fruit and vegetable intake.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} infection is associated with chronic progressive liver disease. Its global epidemiology is still not well ascertained and its impact will be confronted with a higher burden in the next decade. Aim: The goal of this study was to develop a tool that can be used to predict the future prevalence of the disease in different countries and, more importantly, to understand the cause and effect relationship between the key assumptions and future trends.


{METHODS}

A system approach was used to build a simulation model where each population was modeled with the appropriate inflows and outflows. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the key drivers of future prevalence.


{RESULTS}

The total {HCV-infected} population in the {US} was estimated to decline 24\% from 3.15 million in 2005 to 2.47 million in 2021, while disease burden will increase as the remaining infected population ages. During the same period, the mortality rate was forecasted to increase from 2.1 to 3.1\%. The diagnosed population was 50\% of the total infections, while less than 2\% of the total infections were treated.


{CONCLUSION}

We have created a framework to evaluate the {HCV-infected} populations in countries around the world. This model may help assess the impact of policies to meet the challenges predicted by the evolution of {HCV} infection and disease. This prediction tool may help to target new public health strategies.},

	abstract = {Cirrhosis represents the end stage of any chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C and alcohol are currently the main causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Although initially cirrhosis is compensated, it eventually becomes decompensated, as defined by the presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and/or jaundice. These management recommendations are divided according to the status, compensated or decompensated, of the cirrhotic patient, with a separate section for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatocellular carcinoma {(HCC)}, as this applies to patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In the compensated patient, the main objective is to prevent variceal hemorrhage and any practice that could lead to decompensation. In the decompensated patient, acute variceal hemorrhage and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are severe complications that require hospitalization. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a severe complication of cirrhosis but one that usually occurs in patients who are already in the hospital and, as it represents an extreme of the hemodynamic alterations that lead to ascites formation, it is placed under treatment of ascites. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of the complications of cirrhosis have allowed for a more rational management of cirrhosis and also for the stratification of patients into different risk groups that require different management. These recommendations are based on evidence in the literature, mainly from randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses of these trials. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and consensus conferences with involvement of recognized experts. A rational management of cirrhosis will result in improvements in quality of life, treatment adherence, and, ultimately, in outcomes.},

	abstract = {This review has focused on the prevalence and risk factors associated with knee and hip osteoarthritis. Risk factors for knee osteoarthritis are obesity and major injury, and knee osteoarthritis probably fits into the generalized osteoarthritis diathesis. Repetitive use, such as in jobs requiring heavy labor and knee bending, probably increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Hip osteoarthritis is probably frequently secondary to developmental defects. As Rothman (182) has pointed out in discussing causation, this does not necessarily mean that the same factors do not also contribute to causing hip osteoarthritis. Yet, it appears that, in many cases, developmental defects are severe enough to be sufficient causes of hip osteoarthritis. To delineate other causes, it may be necessary to examine risk factors separately in those with and in those without developmental disease. Although large epidemiologic studies are best able to identify the relative contributions of specific risk factors while controlling for other risk factors, new studies need to focus on important unresolved questions. First, longitudinal studies with comprehensive follow-up using repeated radiographic assessments are needed to identify factors that cause development of disease or the onset of symptoms. Second, cohorts with early and possibly asymptomatic disease need to be followed to determine the causes of progression or regression of disease and the natural history of disease. Such cohorts may include those at high risk of injury such as sports enthusiasts or manual laborers.},

Risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, obesity and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption were responsible for much of the overall disease burden in Australia. The lessons learnt from the {ABD} study are discussed, together with methodological issues that require further attention.},

	abstract = {For decades, researchers have noted systematic shifts in cause-of-death patterns as mortality levels change. The notion of the “epidemiologic transition” has influenced thinking about the evolution of health in different societies and the response of the health system to these changes. This article re-examines the epidemiologic transition in terms of empirical regularities in the cause composition of mortality by age and sex since 1950, and considers whether the theory of epidemiologic transition presents a durable framework for understanding more recent patterns. Age-sex-specific mortality rates from three broad cause groups are analyzed: Group 1 (communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal causes, and nutritional deficiencies); Group 2 (noncommunicable diseases); and Group 3 (injuries), using the most extensive international database on mortality by cause, including 1,576 country-years of observation, and new statistical models for compositional data. The analyses relate changes in cause-of-death patterns to changing levels of all-cause mortality and income per capita. The results confirm that declines in overall mortality are accompanied by systematic changes in the composition of causes in many age groups. These changes are most pronounced among children, for whom Group 1 causes decline as overall mortality falls, and in younger adults, where strikingly different patterns are found for men (shift from Group 3 to Group 2) compared to women (shift toward Group 2 then Group 3). The underlying patterns that emerge from this analysis offer insights into the epidemiologic transition from high-mortality to low-mortality settings.},

Epidemiologic information is important to inform etiological research and service delivery planning. However, current information on the epidemiology of alcohol use disorders in the United States is lacking.


{OBJECTIVES}

To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, and treatment of {DSM-IV} alcohol abuse and dependence. Design, Setting, and


{PARTICIPANTS}

Face-to-face interviews with a representative {US} adult sample {(N} = 43 093).


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Lifetime and 12-month {DSM-IV} alcohol abuse and dependence.


{RESULTS}

Prevalence of lifetime and 12-month alcohol abuse was 17.8\% and 4.7\%; prevalence of lifetime and 12-month alcohol dependence was 12.5\% and 3.8\%. Alcohol dependence was significantly more prevalent among men, whites, Native Americans, younger and unmarried adults, and those with lower incomes. Current alcohol abuse was more prevalent among men, whites, and younger and unmarried individuals while lifetime rates were highest among middle-aged Americans. Significant disability was particularly associated with alcohol dependence. Only 24.1\% of those with alcohol dependence were ever treated, slightly less than the treatment rate found 10 years earlier. Strong associations between other substance use disorders and alcohol use disorders (odds ratios, 2.0-18.7) were lower but remained strong and significant (odds ratios, 1.8-7.5) when controlling for other comorbidity. Significant associations between mood, anxiety, and personality disorders and alcohol dependence (odds ratios, 2.1-4.8) were reduced in number and magnitude (odds ratios, 1.5-2.0) when controlling for other comorbidity.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Alcohol abuse and dependence remain highly prevalent and disabling. Comorbidity of alcohol dependence with other substance disorders appears due in part to unique factors underlying etiology for each pair of disorders studied while comorbidity of alcohol dependence with mood, anxiety, and personality disorders appears more attributable to factors shared among these other disorders. Persistent low treatment rates given the availability of effective treatments indicate the need for vigorous education efforts for the public and professionals.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} accounts for approximately 20\% of cases of acute hepatitis, 70\% of chronic hepatitis, and 30\% of end-stage liver disease in the United States. The acute infection has an incubation period of 7 weeks (range, 4-20 weeks) and is symptomatic and icteric in only one third of patients. Serum aminotransferase levels generally increase greater than 10-fold elevated and as symptoms and signs resolve decrease into the normal range. Antibody to {HCV} is usually but not always present at the time of onset of symptoms. {HCV} {RNA} appears in the serum early during the incubation period, increases in titer and peaks at the time of symptoms, and then disappears in resolving disease. Importantly, 85\% of patients with acute {HCV} infection develop chronic infection. In these patients, {HCV} {RNA} remains present and in approximately two thirds of patients, aminotransferases remain elevated in the range of 1.5- to 10-fold the upper limit of normal. The course of chronic hepatitis C is variable. Probably fewer than 20\% of patients have symptoms and they are usually intermittent, vague, and nonspecific, largely being malaise and easy fatiguability. A small percentage of patients develop extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C, including cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis. It is estimated that 20\% to 30\% of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, but the process is generally slow and insidious. Once cirrhosis develops, symptoms are more common and the signs of end-stage liver disease can appear with jaundice, weakness, wasting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cirrhosis are also at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, this important liver disease has protean manifestations but is often insidious and can lead to end-stage liver disease despite the presence of few symptoms and signs of illness.},

The model allows one to consider not only effects on the screened women and their newborns, but also effects on the rest of the population. The analysis reveals that the primary benefit of screening programs targeted to women of childbearing age lies not in the prevention of {HIV} infection in their newborns but in the prevention of infection in their adult contacts. We find that screening medium and high risk women is likely to be cost-beneficial. Screening women regardless of risk group may also be cost-beneficial if screened positive women show relatively modest levels of behavioral change, but screening programs that reach primarily low risk women are not likely to be cost-beneficial. The results hold over a broad range of sensitivity analyses of important variables.},

	abstract = {Abstract We consider the problem of accounting for model uncertainty in linear regression models. Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. A Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models (i.e., combinations of predictors) when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this article we offer two alternative approaches. First, we describe an ad hoc procedure, {“Occam's} window,” which indicates a small set of models over which a model average can be computed. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that directly approximates the exact solution. In the presence of model uncertainty, both of these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but no relationship between any of them and the response, standard variable selection procedures often choose some subset of variables that yields a high R 2 and a highly significant overall F value. In this situation, Occam's window usually indicates the null model (or a small number of models including the null model) as the only one (or ones) to be considered thus largely resolving the problem of selecting significant models when there is no signal in the data. Software to implement our methods is available from {StatLib.}},

	abstract = {The objective of this communication is to introduce a conceptual framework for a study that applies a rigorous systems approach to rural disaster preparedness and planning. System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as "what-if" tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions--for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak--some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To describe a dynamic compartmental simulation model for Botswana and India, developed to identify the best strategies for preventing spread of {HIV/AIDS.}


{METHODS}

The following interventions were considered: a behavioural intervention focused on female sex workers; a conventional programme for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections; a programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission; an antiretroviral treatment programme for the entire population, based on a single regimen; and an antiretroviral treatment programme for sex workers only, also based on a single regimen.


{FINDINGS}

The interventions directed at sex workers as well as those dealing with sexually transmitted infections showed promise for long-term prevention of human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)} infection, although their relative ranking was uncertain. In India, a sex worker intervention would drive the epidemic to extinction. In Botswana none of the interventions alone would achieve this, although the prevalence of {HIV} would be reduced by almost 50\%. Mother-to-child transmission programmes could reduce {HIV} transmission to infants, but would have no impact on the epidemic itself. In the long run, interventions targeting sexual transmission would be even more effective in reducing the number of {HIV-infected} children than mother-to-child transmission programmes. Antiretroviral therapy would prevent transmission in the short term, but eventually its effects would wane because of the development of drug resistance.


{CONCLUSION}

Depending on the country and how the antiretroviral therapy was targeted, 25-100\% of {HIV} cases would be drug- resistant after 30 years of use.},

	abstract = {For epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, and health-care professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches. Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include {BSE}, foot-and-mouth, {HIV}, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or {culling.Comprehensive}, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling Builds from simple to complex predictive models Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and {MATLAB} In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control},

Linear and restricted cubic spline Cox regressions were fitted on variables of intake of fruits and vegetables and adjusted for potential confounders. We observed a significant inverse association with combined total fruits and vegetables intake (estimated relative risk {(RR)} = 0.91; 95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI)} 0.83-1.00 per 80 g/d of consumption), and nearly significant inverse associations in separate analyses with total fruits and total vegetables intake {(RR:} 0.97 (95\% {CI:} 0.92-1.02) and {RR} = 0.89 (95\% {CI:} 0.78-1.02) per 40 g/d of consumption). Overall, vegetable subgroups were not related to risk with the exception of intake of root vegetables in men. Restricted cubic spline regression did not improve the linear model fits except for total fruits and vegetables and total fruits with a significant decrease in risk at low intake levels ({\textless}120 g/d) for fruits.

{ABSTRACT:}


{BACKGROUND}

Data on causes of death by age and sex are a critical input into health decision-making. Priority setting in public health should be informed not only by the current magnitude of health problems but by trends in them. However, cause of death data are often not available or are subject to substantial problems of comparability. We propose five general principles for cause of death model development, validation, and reporting.


{METHODS}

We detail a specific implementation of these principles that is embodied in an analytical tool - the Cause of Death Ensemble model {(CODEm)} - which explores a large variety of possible models to estimate trends in causes of death. Possible models are identified using a covariate selection algorithm that yields many plausible combinations of covariates, which are then run through four model classes. The model classes include mixed effects linear models and spatial-temporal Gaussian Process Regression models for cause fractions and death rates. All models for each cause of death are then assessed using out-of-sample predictive validity and combined into an ensemble with optimal out-of-sample predictive performance.


{RESULTS}

Ensemble models for cause of death estimation outperform any single component model in tests of root mean square error, frequency of predicting correct temporal trends, and achieving 95\% coverage of the prediction interval. We present detailed results for {CODEm} applied to maternal mortality and summary results for several other causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and several cancers.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{CODEm} produces better estimates of cause of death trends than previous methods and is less susceptible to bias in model specification. We demonstrate the utility of {CODEm} for the estimation of several major causes of death.},

Such a framework is increasingly important in light of the widespread concern for primary health care programs aimed at such diseases as measles, malaria, river blindness, sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis, and the advent of {AIDS/HIV} and other emerging viruses. Throughout the book, the mathematics is used as a tool for thinking clearly about fundamental and applied problems having to do with infectious diseases. The book is divided into two parts, one dealing with microparasites (viruses, bacteria and protozoans) and the other with macroparasites (helminths and parasitic arthropods). Each part begins with simple models, developed in a biologically intuitive way, and then goes on to develop more complicated and realistic models as tools for public health planning.

We also propose a new approach to the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which may improve the diagnostic accuracy. The available information on autopsy findings in patients clinically diagnosed as Parkinson's disease shows that 20 to 30\% of these patients do not have the typical neuropathological features with Lewy bodies and cell loss in the substantia nigra. The use of selected additional clinical criteria improves the diagnostic accuracy, however, at the cost of rejecting a rather large group of patients with idiopathic disease verified by autopsy. Based on this fact and a review of the literature on parkinsonian syndromes that may be confused with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, we propose criteria for diagnostic subgroups of the disease classified at different levels of confidence. The suggested diagnostic subgroups are clinical definite, probable and possible Parkinson's disease with a decreasing level of specificity and an increasing level of sensitivity in the different patient categories. The clinical features given special importance in this classification includes presence of resting tremor, asymmetrical disease, response to dopamine agonism and presence of atypical clinical features like dementia and clinical autonomic failure at onset and pyramidal or cerebellar signs at examination. In addition, a history indicating possible etiology for another parkinsonian syndrome will exclude the diagnosis.},

	abstract = {An important problem in the implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms is to determine the convergence time, or the number of iterations before the chain is close to stationarity. For many Markov chains used in practice this time is not known. There does not seem to be a general technique for upper bounding the convergence time that gives sufficiently sharp (useful in practice) bounds in all cases of interest. Thus, practitioners like to carry out some form of statistical analysis in order to assess convergence. This has led to the development of a number of methods known as convergence diagnostics which attempt to diagnose whether the Markov chain is far from stationarity. We study the problem of testing convergence in the following settings and prove that the problem is hard computationally: • Given a Markov chain that mixes rapidly, it is hard for Statistical Zero Knowledge {(SZK-hard)} to distinguish whether starting from a given state, the chain is close to stationarity by time t or far from stationarity at time ct for a constant c . We show the problem is in {AM} ∩ {coAM.} • Given a Markov chain that mixes rapidly it is {coNP-hard} to distinguish from an arbitrary starting state whether it is close to stationarity by time t or far from stationarity at time ct for a constant c . The problem is in {coAM.} • It is {PSPACE-complete} to distinguish whether the Markov chain is close to stationarity by time t or still far from stationarity at time ct for c ≥ 1.},

We present new evidence on risk for starting to use marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, as well as risks for progression from first drug use to the onset of drug dependence, separately for each of these drugs. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey {(NCS)} were analyzed. The {NCS} had a representative sample of the United States population ages 15-54 years (n = 8,098). Survival analysis techniques were used to provide age- and time-specific risk estimates of initiating use of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, as well as of becoming dependent on each drug. With respect to risk of initiating use, estimated peak values for alcohol and marijuana were found at age 18, about two years earlier than the later peak in risk of initiating cocaine use. With respect to risk of meeting criteria for the clinical dependence syndrome, estimated peak values for alcohol and marijuana were found at age 17-18. Peak values for cocaine dependence were found at age 23-25. Once use began, cocaine dependence emerged early and more explosively, with an estimated 5-6\% of cocaine users becoming cocaine dependent in the first year of use. Most of the observed cases of cocaine dependence met criteria for dependence within three years after initial cocaine use. Whereas some 15-16\% of cocaine users had developed cocaine dependence within 10 years of first cocaine use, the corresponding values were about 8\% for marijuana users, and 12-13\% for alcohol users. The most novel findings of this study document a noteworthy risk for quickly developing cocaine dependence after initial cocaine use, with about one in 16 to 20 cocaine users becoming dependent within the first year of cocaine use. For marijuana and alcohol, there is a more insidious onset of the drug dependence syndrome.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To determine the incidence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis {(OA)} and symptomatic {OA} (symptoms plus radiographic {OA)}, as well as the rate of progression of preexisting radiographic {OA} in a population-based sample of elderly persons.


{METHODS}

Framingham Osteoarthritis Study subjects who had knee radiographs and had answered questions about knee symptoms in 1983-1985 were reexamined in 1992-1993 (mean 8.1-year interval) using the same protocol. Subjects were defined as having new (incident) radiographic {OA} if they developed grade {\textgreater} or = 2 {OA} (at least definite osteophytes or definite joint space narrowing). New symptomatic {OA} was present if subjects developed a combination of knee symptoms and grade {\textgreater} or = 2 {OA.} Progressive {OA} was diagnosed when radiographs showing grade 2 disease at baseline showed grade {\textgreater} or = 3 disease on followup.


{RESULTS}

Of 1,438 participants in the original study, 387 (26.9\%) died prior to followup. Of the 1,051 surviving subjects, 869 (82.7\%) participated in the followup study (mean +/- {SD} age 70.8 +/- 5.0 at baseline). Rates of incident disease were 1.7 times higher in women than in men (95\% confidence interval {[CI]} 1.0-2.7), and progressive disease occurred slightly more often in women (relative risk = 1.4; 95\% {CI} 0.8-2.5) but rates did not vary by age in this sample. Among women, approximately 2\% per year developed incident radiographic disease, 1\% per year developed symptomatic knee {OA}, and about 4\% per year experienced progressive knee {OA.}


{CONCLUSION}

In elderly persons, the new onset of knee {OA} is frequent and is more common in women than men. However, among the elderly, age may not affect new disease occurrence or progression.},

	abstract = {In Egypt, schistosomiasis was traditionally the most important public health problem and infection with Schistosoma mansoni the major cause of liver disease. From the 1950s until the 1980s, the Egyptian Ministry of Health {(MOH)} undertook large control campaigns using intravenous tartar emetic, the standard treatment for schistosomiasis, as community-wide therapy. This commendable effort to control a major health problem unfortunately established a very large reservoir of hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} in the country. By the mid-1980s, the effective oral drug, praziquantel, replaced tartar emetic a s treatment f o r schistosomiasis in the entire country. This both reduced schistosomal transmission and disease and interrupted the "occult" {HCV} epidemic. It was evident when diagnostic serology became available in the 1990s that {HCV} had replaced schistosomiasis as the predominant cause of chronic liver disease. Epidemiological studies reported a high prevalence and incidence of {HCV}, particutarly within families in rural areas endemic for schistosomiasis. Clinical studies showed 70\% to 90\% of patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma had {HCV} infections. Co-infections with schistosomiasis caused more severe liver disease than infection with {HCV} alone. Schistosomiasis was reported to cause an imbalance in {HCV-specific} T-cell responses leading to increased viral load, a higher probability of {HCV} chronicity, and more rapid progression of complications in co-infected persons. As complications of {HCV} usually occur after 20 years of infection, the peak impact of the Egyptian outbreak has not yet occurred. Efforts have been initiated by the Egyptian {MOH} to prevent new infections and complications of {HCV} in the estimated 6 million infected persons.},

Both catenary and mammillary models were identified, and their predictions for the tracer behavior in nonaccessible pools were evaluated. In all experiments, regardless of the model structure, predictions in the compartment most rapidly exchanging with blood (pool 2) well matched the measured tracer-to-tracee ratio in {TDL.} Furthermore, modeling analysis showed that 90-95\% of the tracer in {TDL} comes from this pool. This supported the physiological identification of a peripheral pool of glucose kinetics as extracellular fluid represented by {TDL} measurements.},

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Maternal mortality remains a major challenge to health systems worldwide. Reliable information about the rates and trends in maternal mortality is essential for resource mobilisation, and for planning and assessment of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 {(MDG} 5), the target for which is a 75\% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio {(MMR)} from 1990 to 2015. We assessed levels and trends in maternal mortality for 181 countries.
Methods
We constructed a database of 2651 observations of maternal mortality for 181 countries for 1980–2008, from vital registration data, censuses, surveys, and verbal autopsy studies. We used robust analytical methods to generate estimates of maternal deaths and the {MMR} for each year between 1980 and 2008. We explored the sensitivity of our data to model specification and show the out-of-sample predictive validity of our methods.
Findings
We estimated that there were 342 900 (uncertainty interval 302 100–394 300) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008, down from 526 300 (446 400–629 600) in 1980. The global {MMR} decreased from 422 (358–505) in 1980 to 320 (272–388) in 1990, and was 251 (221–289) per 100 000 livebirths in 2008. The yearly rate of decline of the global {MMR} since 1990 was 1·3\% (1·0–1·5). During 1990–2008, rates of yearly decline in the {MMR} varied between countries, from 8·8\% (8·7–14·1) in the Maldives to an increase of 5·5\% (5·2–5·6) in Zimbabwe. More than 50\% of all maternal deaths were in only six countries in 2008 {(India}, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In the absence of {HIV}, there would have been 281 500 (243 900–327 900) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008.
Interpretation
Substantial, albeit varied, progress has been made towards {MDG} 5. Although only 23 countries are on track to achieve a 75\% decrease in {MMR} by 2015, countries such as Egypt, China, Ecuador, and Bolivia have been achieving accelerated progress.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

We systematically reviewed availability and quality of data on the prevalence of use and dependence on meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioids.


{METHODS}

Multiple search strategies: (a) peer-reviewed literature searches (1990-2008) using methods recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology {(MOOSE)} group; (b) systematic searches of online databases; (c) Internet searches to find other published evidence of drug use; (d) repeated consultation and feedback from experts around the globe; (e) a viral email sent to lists of researchers in the illicit drug and {HIV} fields. Data were extracted and graded according to predefined variables reflecting quality of data source.


{RESULTS}

Qualitative evidence of illicit drug use and dependence was found for most countries, which hold over 98\% of the world's population aged 15-64 years. Countries where use was identified but prevalence estimates had not been made (evidence of drug supply, trafficking, reports of use, treatment data) were mainly from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. Estimates of the prevalence of use were located in 77 countries for meth/amphetamine, 95 for cannabis, 86 for cocaine and 89 for opioids. Dependence prevalence estimates existed in very few countries; 9 meth/amphetamine dependence estimates, 7 cannabis dependence estimates, 5 cocaine dependence estimates, and 25 opioid dependence estimates were located.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Data on the extent of meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid use and dependence must be improved in quality and coverage. Dependence estimates are lacking even in high income countries that have required resources. Responses to illicit drug dependence require better estimates of its scale.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

The symptomatology of cannabis dependence remains ill-defined and its importance controversial. Compared with alcohol dependence, the symptom profile of cannabis dependence has received little attention. We aimed to (a) report cannabis use in a representative population of young adults, (b) examine cannabis dependence symptoms according to frequency in the dependence syndrome and (c) contrast the symptomatology of cannabis and alcohol syndromes.


{METHODS}

1601 young adults (mean age 20.7 years) from an Australian longitudinal cohort study {(N=2032)} were surveyed in 1998. Regular substance users were assessed for {DSM-IV} cannabis and alcohol dependence. Prevalence estimates allowed for sampling variation and attrition.


{RESULTS}

Fifty-nine per cent reported life-time use of cannabis, 17\% used at least weekly and 7\% (11\% males, 4\% females) met criteria for cannabis dependence. Symptom prevalence in dependent cannabis users was: persistent desire 91\%; unintentional use 84\%; withdrawal 74\%; excessive time obtaining/using 74\%; continued use despite health problems 63\%; tolerance 21\%; and social consequences 18\%. The combination of withdrawal, persistent desire and unintentional use was reported by 57\%. Dependent cannabis users reported compulsive and out-of-control use more frequently than dependent alcohol users, withdrawal similarly and tolerance considerably less often.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Cannabis use appears to be normative behaviour in young Australians. Progression beyond weekly use of cannabis carries a significant risk of dependence that should be considered in the public health response. The differing profiles of cannabis and alcohol dependence, particularly with regard to craving, draws attention to the need for further study of cannabis dependence as an important and distinct disorder in young adults.},

There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for {SCI} up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that {SCI} was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by {SCI} is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that {SCI} has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in {SSCI} was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by {SSCI} was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on {SCI}, {SSCI} and Arts and Humanities Citation Index {(AHCI).} Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

	abstract = {Although Parkinson's disease {(PD)} is the only chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are effective symptomatic therapies no treatment has yet been identified that would significantly slow its natural progression. Studies into the natural history of Parkinson's disease have been complicated by issues of diagnostic accuracy, heterogeneity of different forms of the disease as well as confounding effects of age related comorbidities. Only recently results from placebo-controlled clinical trials have helped to define the rates of progression of motor dysfunction as assessed by the {UPDRS} in early {PD.} Studies in treated patients suggest that there may be different rates of progression in different phases of the disease with faster decline in earlier versus later stages. Measuring progression of motor symptoms, however, alone is insufficient to describe the natural history of {PD} and may also be inadequate to define clinically meaningful disease modification in intervention trials. Progression of global disability as captured in the Hoehn and Yahr scale is important to consider and progression to stage {III} with beginning postural impairment defines a major milestone in the natural history of this illness. In addition, non-motor symptoms have major impact on the natural history of {PD.} Dementia, sleep-wake cycle dysregulation and autonomic failure were present in 50-80\% of patients in one recent 15 year-follow up study. Dementia and psychosis are also major risk factors for nursing home placement in {PD.} A prerequisite for effective interventions that would modify disease progression in Parkinson's disease is the identification of the earliest preclinical stages of illness. This is now become a realistic possibility with screening tests of olfactory function and subsequent functional imaging. Subjects at risk for Parkinson's disease should be the future focus of neuroprotective trials.},

	abstract = {Several valuable data sources, including the census and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, include data measured using interval responses. Many empirical studies attempt estimation by assuming the data correspond to the interval midpoints and then use {OLS} or maximum likelihood assuming normality. Stata performs maximum likelihood estimates {(MLE)} under the assumption of normality, allowing for intra-group variation. In the presence of heteroskedasticity or distributional misspecification, these estimates are inconsistent. In this paper we focus on an estimation procedure that helps prevent distributional misspecification for interval censored data. We explore the application of partially adaptive estimation, which builds on the {MLE} framework with families of flexible parametric probability density functions which include the normal as a limiting case. These methods are used to estimate determinants associated with household expenditures based on {US} Census data. Monte Carlo Simulations are performed to compare the relative efficiency of the different methods of estimation. We find that the flexible nature of our proposed partially adaptive estimation technique significantly reduces estimator bias and improves efficiency in the presence of distributional misspecification.},

As before, epidemics of this sandfly-borne disease occur periodically in India and elsewhere; but leishmaniasis has also emerged in new regions and settings, for example, as an {AIDS-associated} opportunistic infection. Diagnosis still typically relies on classic microbiological methods, but molecular-based approaches are being tested. Pentavalent antimony compounds have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for half a century, but lipid formulations of amphotericin B (though expensive and administered parenterally) represent a major advance for treating visceral leishmaniasis. A pressing need is for the technological advances in the understanding of the immune response to leishmania and the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis to be translated into field-applicable and affordable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease.},

Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder are diagnoses of exclusion; therefore, alternative explanations for symptoms must be considered before either diagnosis is made. The disorders can manifest with a wide variety of symptoms, including depression, mood lability, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, headache, and fatigue. Women with mild symptoms should be instructed about lifestyle changes, including healthy diet, sodium and caffeine restriction, exercise, and stress reduction. Supportive strategies, such as use of a symptom diary, may be helpful in diagnosing and managing the disorders. In women with moderate symptoms, treatment includes both medication and lifestyle modifications. Dietary supplements, such as calcium and evening primrose oil, may offer modest benefit. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline are the most effective pharmacologic agents. Prostaglandin inhibitors and diuretics may provide some relief of symptoms. Only weak evidence supports the effectiveness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, androgenic agents, estrogen, progesterone, or other psychotropics, and side effects limit their use.},

Assuming that f is continuous on a compact level set, the subsequence convergence of the iterates to a stationary point is shown when either f is pseudoconvex in every pair of coordinate blocks from among N-1 coordinate blocks or f has at most one minimum in each of N-2 coordinate blocks. If f is quasiconvex and hemivariate in every coordinate block, then the assumptions of continuity of f and compactness of the level set may be relaxed further. These results are applied to derive new (and old) convergence results for the proximal minimization algorithm, an algorithm of Arimoto and Blahut, and an algorithm of Han. They are applied also to a problem of blind source separation.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10752705},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The population of Egypt has a heavy burden of liver disease, mostly due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus {(HCV).} Overall prevalence of antibody to {HCV} in the general population is around 15-20\%. The risk factor for {HCV} transmission that specifically sets Egypt apart from other countries is a personal history of parenteral antischistosomal therapy {(PAT).} A review of the Egyptian {PAT} mass-treatment campaigns, discontinued only in the 1980s, show a very high potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. We examine the relative importance of {PAT} in the spread of {HCV} in Egypt.


{METHODS}

The degree of exposure to {PAT} by cohort was estimated from 1961-86 Ministry of Health data. A cohort-specific exposure index for {PAT} was calculated and compared with cohort-specific {HCV} prevalence rates in four regions.


{FINDINGS}

{HCV} prevalence was calculated for 8499 Egyptians aged 10-50 years. A significant association between seroprevalence of antibodies to {HCV} and the exposure index (1.31 [95\% {CI} 1.08-1.59]; p=0.007) was identified across four different regions. In all regions cohort-specific {HCV} prevalence was lowest in children and young adults than in older cohorts. These lower prevalence rates coincided with the gradual and final replacement of {PAT} with oral antischistosomal drugs at different points in time in the four regions.


{INTERPRETATION}

The data suggest that {PAT} had a major role in the spread of {HCV} throughout Egypt. This intensive transmission established a large reservoir of chronic {HCV} infection, responsible for the high prevalence of {HCV} infection and current high rates of transmission. Egypt's mass campaigns of {PAT} may represent the world's largest iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne pathogens.},

This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

The application of simulation in health services is reviewed. A comparison is made between the {SD} and traditional simulation approaches and is illustrated by considering reductions in waiting times for coronary heart disease treatment. Traditionally, simulation studies have tended to focus on the analysis of localized decisions and therefore on problems orientated towards individual patients. Although these methods are extremely powerful and effective, there is scope for an alternative modelling approach which is based on a more holistic perspective; {SD} is one such approach. It can assist in the design of robust policies by supporting debate on how the underlying structure might influence the evolutionary behaviour of a system. Using this method we can consider the time variation both of tangibles, such as waiting times and health care costs, and intangibles, such as patient anxiety and the effects of various pressures on purchasing decisions. We propose that {SD} holds great potential in assisting policy formation in health care.},

	abstract = {Summary: A key element to a successful Markov chain Monte Carlo {(MCMC)} inference is the programming and run performance of the Markov chain. However, the explicit use of quality assessments of the {MCMC} simulations—convergence diagnostics—in phylogenetics is still uncommon. Here, we present a simple tool that uses the output from {MCMC} simulations and visualizes a number of properties of primary interest in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, such as convergence rates of posterior split probabilities and branch lengths. Graphical exploration of the output from phylogenetic {MCMC} simulations gives intuitive and often crucial information on the success and reliability of the analysis. The tool presented here complements convergence diagnostics already available in other software packages primarily designed for other applications of {MCMC.} Importantly, the common practice of using trace-plots of a single parameter or summary statistic, such as the likelihood score of sampled trees, can be misleading for assessing the success of a phylogenetic {MCMC} simulation.

This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a Markov chain having π as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov chain should be rapidly mixing. This sometimes can be achieved only by careful design of the transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of π. An alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of π are encountered during the {MCMC} run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, then the stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often but does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample path averages.},

	abstract = {Mathematical Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases Model Building, Analysis and Interpretation O. Diekmann University of Utrecht, The Netherlands J. A. P. Heesterbeek Centre for Biometry Wageningen, The Netherlands The mathematical modelling of epidemics in populations is a vast and important area of study. It is about translating biological assumptions into mathematics, about mathematical analysis aided by interpretation and about obtaining insight into epidemic phenomena when translating mathematical results back into population biology. Model assumptions are formulated in terms of, usually stochastic, behaviour of individuals and then the resulting phenomena, at the population level, are unravelled. Conceptual clarity is attained, assumptions are stated clearly, hidden working hypotheses are attained and mechanistic links between different observables are exposed. Features:* Model construction, analysis and interpretation receive detailed attention* Uniquely covers both deterministic and stochastic viewpoints* Examples of applications given throughout* Extensive coverage of the latest research into the mathematical modelling of epidemics of infectious diseases* Provides a solid foundation of modelling {skillsThe} reader will learn to translate, model, analyse and interpret, with the help of the numerous exercises. In literally working through this text, the reader acquires modelling skills that are also valuable outside of epidemiology, certainly within population dynamics, but even beyond that. In addition, the reader receives training in mathematical argumentation. The text is aimed at applied mathematicians with an interest in population biology and epidemiology, at theoretical biologists and epidemiologists. Previous exposure to epidemic concepts is not required, as all background information is given. The book is primarily aimed at self-study and ideally suited for small discussion groups, or for use as a course text.},

	abstract = {The family Trypanosomatidae consists of many parasitic flagellate protozoans. Two genera, Trypanosoma and Leishmania, include important pathogens of humans and domestic animals. The diseases caused by these protozoa are endemic or enzootic in different parts of the world and constitute serious medical and economic problems. Because these protozoans require hematin obtained from blood hemoglobin for aerobic respiration, they are called hemoflagellates. The digenetic (two-host) life cycles of both genera involve an insect and a vertebrate. The family also includes the digenetic genus Phytomonas, which infects plants, and some monogenetic (one-host) species which infect only invertebrate hosts. The hemoflagellates have up to eight life cycle stages which differ in the placement and origin of the flagellum. Two stages—the amastigote and the trypomastigote—may occur in vertebrate hosts, and three stages,—the promastigote, paramastigote, and epimastigote—in invertebrate hosts {(Fig.} 82-1). Besides the nucleus and the flagellum, a trypanosomatic cell has a unique organelle called the kinetoplast. The kinetoplast appears to be a special part of the mitochondrion and is rich in {DNA.} Two types of {DNA} molecules, maxicircles which encode mainly certain important mitochondrial enzymes, and minicircles which serve a function in the processof {RNA} editing, have been found in the kinetoplast; when Giemsa stained, the kinetoplast is reddish purple and darker than the nucleus, contrasting with the pale blue cytoplasm. Monogenetic trypanosomatids are more primitive than the digenetic species and grow easily in synthetic culture media. Some digenetic species can be cultivated in complex synthetic media. The medium most commonly used is {NNN} medium, which has a solid phase of rabbit blood agar and a liquid phase of a physiologic salt solution. Liquid media are also available. Only the invertebrate stages appear in such media, and they may or may not be infectious for the vertebrate hosts, depending on the species. Replication of trypanosomatids occurs by single or multiple fission, involving first the kinetoplast, then the nucleus, and finally the cytoplasm. However, evidence for sexual reproduction has been presented.},

While this may be relevant for defining the extent and demographic pattern of disabilities in a population, and thus indicating the need for rehabilitative services, prevention requires detailed information on the underlying diseases and injuries that cause disabilities. The Global Burden of Disease methodology described in this paper provides a mechanism for quantifying the health consequences of the years of life lived with disabilities by first estimating the age-sex-specific incidence rates of underlying conditions, and then mapping these to a single disability index which collectively reflects the probability of progressing to a disability, the duration of life lived with the disability, and the approximate severity of the disability in terms of activity restriction. Detailed estimates of the number of disability-adjusted life years {(DALYs)} lived are provided in this paper, for eight geographical regions. The results should be useful to those concerned with planning health services for the disabled and, more particularly, with determining policies to prevent the underlying conditions which give rise to serious disabling sequelae.},

Bipolar disorder has always been highly recurrent and considered to have a poor prognosis. Bipolar patients who have been hospitalized spend about 20\% of their lifetime from the onset of their disorder in episodes. Fifty percent of bipolar episodes last between 2 and 7 months (median 3 months). The intervals between the first few episodes tend to shorten; later the episodes return at an irregular rhythm of about 0.4 episodes per year with high interindividual variability. Switches from mania into mild depression and from depression into hypomania were frequently reported in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Antidepressant and antimanic drugs have to be given as long as the natural episode lasts. Given the poor outcome of bipolar disorders found in naturalistic follow-up studies and our lifelong investigation, intensive antidepressant, antimanic, and mood-stabilizing treatments are required in most cases. Despite modern treatments the outcome into old age is still poor, full recovery without further episodes rare, recurrence of episodes with incomplete remission the rule, and the development of chronicity and suicide still frequent.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60703-9},
	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Previous assessments have highlighted that less than a quarter of countries are on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 {(MDG} 4), which calls for a two-thirds reduction in mortality in children younger than 5 years between 1990 and 2015. In view of policy initiatives and investments made since 2000, it is important to see if there is acceleration towards the {MDG} 4 target. We assessed levels and trends in child mortality for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010.
Methods
We compiled a database of 16 174 measurements of mortality in children younger than 5 years for 187 countries from 1970 to 2009, by use of data from all available sources, including vital registration systems, summary birth histories in censuses and surveys, and complete birth histories. We used Gaussian process regression to generate estimates of the probability of death between birth and age 5 years. This is the first study that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate child mortality, and this technique has better out-of-sample predictive validity than do previous methods and captures uncertainty caused by sampling and non-sampling error across data types. Neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality was estimated from mortality in children younger than 5 years by use of the 1760 measurements from vital registration systems and complete birth histories that contained specific information about neonatal and postneonatal mortality.
Findings
Worldwide mortality in children younger than 5 years has dropped from 11·9 million deaths in 1990 to 7·7 million deaths in 2010, consisting of 3·1 million neonatal deaths, 2·3 million postneonatal deaths, and 2·3 million childhood deaths (deaths in children aged 1–4 years). 33·0\% of deaths in children younger than 5 years occur in south Asia and 49·6\% occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with less than 1\% of deaths occurring in high-income countries. Across 21 regions of the world, rates of neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality are declining. The global decline from 1990 to 2010 is 2·1\% per year for neonatal mortality, 2·3\% for postneonatal mortality, and 2·2\% for childhood mortality. In 13 regions of the world, including all regions in sub-Saharan Africa, there is evidence of accelerating declines from 2000 to 2010 compared with 1990 to 2000. Within sub-Saharan Africa, rates of decline have increased by more than 1\% in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and The Gambia.
Interpretation
Robust measurement of mortality in children younger than 5 years shows that accelerating declines are occurring in several low-income countries. These positive developments deserve attention and might need enhanced policy attention and resources.

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Premenstrual syndrome is believed to affect 30\% to 80\% of women. Studies in various cultures have used a variety of methodologies to determine prevalence, symptom profile, and effectiveness of available treatments. This study was designed to provide information on incidence of {PMS} and therapies used based on a national probability sample of {US} women.


{METHOD}

In 1996 a national probability sample {(N} = 1052) of women aged 21 to 64 years was surveyed by telephone using random digit dial methods. The survey included demographic information, questions concerning respondent knowledge of premenstrual syndrome, incidence rates of common premenstrual syndrome symptoms, and any remedies that were used to control the symptoms.


{RESULTS}

Forty-one percent of the women responded "yes" to the question, {"Do} you suffer from premenstrual syndrome?" An additional 17\% indicated that they experienced symptoms prior to their menstrual cycle that are commonly associated with premenstrual syndrome (e.g., pain, bloating, feeling more emotional, weight gain, food cravings), though without associating these symptoms with premenstrual syndrome explicity. The most frequently noted severe symptom was that of "[feeling] more emotional." Of those reporting premenstrual syndrome symptoms, approximately 42\% took either prescription or over-the-counter medications to relieve them. Eighty percent of the women taking any type of medication relied on over-the-counter medications. Prescription drug use for premenstrual syndrome symptoms focused on medications to control pain; hormone supplements were the second most frequently prescribed rugs. Fewer than 3\% of the respondents used prescription medications. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they had used a complementary medical therapy to control symptoms. Exercise was used most frequently (18\%), and acupuncture was the least frequently used. Although only a small percentage of women used complementary therapies, for most of these therapies a near-perfect concordance was found between usage and belief in efficacy.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Women were aware of symptoms related to premenstrual syndrome more frequently than they recognized a formalized medical syndrome. Less than half of the women reporting symptoms had taken either over-the-counter or prescription drugs. Those who tried complementary therapies generally found them to be effective.},

This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, {TGFSR}, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of {MT} with computational complexity O(p2) where  p is the degree of the {polynomial.We} implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification.

	abstract = {The main technique used in algorithm design for approximating heart of the method is the study of the convergence (mixing) rates of particular Markov chains of interest. In this paper we illustrate a new approach to the coupling technique, which we call path coupling, for bounding mixing rates. Previous applications of coupling have required detailed insights into the combinatorics of the problem at hand, and this complexity can make the technique extremely difficult to apply successfully. Path coupling helps to minimize the combinatorial difficulty and in all cases provides simpler convergence proofs than does the standard coupling method. However the true power of the method is that the simplification obtained may allow coupling proofs which were previously unknown, or provide significantly better bounds than those obtained using the standard method. We apply the path coupling method to several hard combinatorial problems, obtaining new or improved results. We examine combinatorial problems such as graph colouring and {TWICE-SAT}, and problems from statistical physics, such as the antiferromagnetic Potts model and the hard-core lattice gas model. In each case we provide either a proof of rapid mixing where none was known previously, or substantial simplification of existing proofs with consequent gains in the performance of the resulting algorithms},

Associated cardiac conditions were severe rheumatic mitral regurgitation (3 cases), cardiomyopathy (5), atrial tumors (2), infective endocarditis (1), paroxysmal atrial tachycardia of infants (4), idiopathic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (1), Marfan's syndrome with mitral regurgitation (1), endocardial fibroelastosis (1), and structural congenital heart malformations (17). Surgical correction of congenital heart lesions was directly related to the development of atrial fibrillation in 14. Varying arrhythmias of the sick-sinus syndrome were observed in five children. The atrial fibrillation was paroxysmal or transient in 21 patients and persistent in 14. Treatment depended on the underlying condition. Digoxin was used in all cases and cardioversion attempted in ten; no patient was given anticoagulants. Three children had cerebral emboli, with residual defects. Eighteen patients are known to be alive, 13 are dead, and 4 are lost to follow-up. Atrial fibrillation in childhood is an indication for complete investigation of the patient and for the institution of treatment appropriate to the underlying disease.},

In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces {MCMC} methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of {MCMC} methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying {MCMC} in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing {MCMC}, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of {MCMC} in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for {MCMC} to be applied to other fields as well.},

In 1997, Luby and Vigoda described a rapidly mixing Markov chain for independent sets, which we refer to as the {Luby–Vigoda} chain. A new rapidly mixing Markov chain for independent sets is defined in this paper. Using path coupling, we obtain a polynomial upper bound for the mixing time of the new chain for a certain range of values of the parameter λ. This range is wider than the range for which the mixing time of the {Luby–Vigoda} chain is known to be polynomially bounded. Moreover, the upper bound on the mixing time of the new chain is always smaller than the best known upper bound on the mixing time of the {Luby–Vigoda} chain for larger values of λ (unless the maximum degree of the graph is 4). An extension of the chain to independent sets in hypergraphs is described. This chain gives an efficient method for approximately counting the number of independent sets of hypergraphs with maximum degree two, or with maximum degree three and maximum edge size three. Finally, we describe a method which allows one, under certain circumstances, to deduce the rapid mixing of one Markov chain from the rapid mixing of another, with the same state space and stationary distribution. This method is applied to two Markov chains for independent sets, a simple insert/delete chain, and the new chain, to show that the insert/delete chain is rapidly mixing for a wider range of values of λ than was previously known.},

{ABSTRACT:}


{BACKGROUND}

Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally; yet the overall burden of diarrhea in terms of duration and severity has not been quantified. As improvements in treatment lead to decreases in diarrhea mortality, it is important to understand the substantial impact of diarrhea morbidity on disability among children and adults worldwide.


{METHODS}

We conducted a systematic review to generate estimates of duration and severity outcomes for individuals 0-59 mos, 5-15 yrs, and ≥ 16 yrs, and for 3 severity indexes: mild, moderate, and severe.


{RESULTS}

We estimate that among children under-five, 64.8\% of diarrheal episodes are mild, 34.7\% are moderate, and 0.5\% are severe. On average, mild episodes last 4.3 days, and severe episodes last 8.4 days and cause dehydration in 84.6\% of cases. We estimate that among older children and adults, 95\% of episodes are mild; 4.95\% are moderate; and 0.05\% are severe. Among individuals ≥ 16 yrs, severe episodes typically last 2.6 days and cause dehydration in 92.8\% of cases.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Moderate and severe episodes constitute a substantial portion of the total envelope of diarrhea among children under-five (35.2\%; about 588 million episodes). Among older children and adults, moderate and severe episodes account for a much smaller proportion of the total envelope of diarrhea (5\%), but the absolute number of such episodes is noteworthy (about 21.5 million episodes among individuals ≥ 16 yrs). Hence, the global burden of diarrhea consists of significant morbidity, extending beyond episodes progressing to death.},

We wish to determine the frequency of {TBI}, special groups at risk for {TBI}, and mortality from {TBI.Methods:} We reviewed studies of {TBI} that are either population based or derived from definable catchment areas that allow determination of incidence, identification of risk groups, and mortality. We review methodology used in epidemiologic studies of {TBI} and try to distinguish this data from that of head injury not necessarily affecting the brain. We report epidemiologic characteristics of {TBI}, including incidence, differences by age, gender, race and ethnic group, and geographic variation, and {mortality.Results:} Population-based studies in the United States suggest that the incidence of {TBI} is between 180 and 250 per 100,000 population per year. Incidence may be higher in Europe and South Africa. There are groups at high risk for {TBI.} This includes males and individuals living in regions characterized by socioeconomic deprivation. There are selective age groups at risk for {TBI.} This includes the very young, adolescents and young adults, and the elderly. Mortality varies by severity but is high in those with severe injury and in the {elderly.Conclusions:} {TBI} is a major public health problem as well as a major cause of epilepsy. If primary prevention is to be undertaken, we must understand the epidemiology of the condition. The primary causes of {TBI} vary by age, socioeconomic factors, and geographic region, so any planned interventions must be tailored accordingly.},

	abstract = {Summary
Traumatic brain injury {(TBI)} is a major health and socioeconomic problem that affects all societies. In recent years, patterns of injury have been changing, with more injuries, particularly contusions, occurring in older patients. Blast injuries have been identified as a novel entity with specific characteristics. Traditional approaches to the classification of clinical severity are the subject of debate owing to the widespread policy of early sedation and ventilation in more severely injured patients, and are being supplemented with structural and functional neuroimaging. Basic science research has greatly advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in secondary damage, creating opportunities for medical intervention and targeted therapies; however, translating this research into patient benefit remains a challenge. Clinical management has become much more structured and evidence based since the publication of guidelines covering many aspects of care. In this Review, we summarise new developments and current knowledge and controversies, focusing on moderate and severe {TBI} in adults. Suggestions are provided for the way forward, with an emphasis on epidemiological monitoring, trauma organisation, and approaches to management.},

	abstract = {Acute pancreatitis is a common disease with an annual incidence of between 5 and 80 people per 100 000 of the population. The two major etiological factors responsible for acute pancreatitis are alcohol and cholelithiasis (gallstones). The proportion of patients with pancreatitis caused by alcohol or gallstones varies markedly in different countries and regions. The incidence of acute alcoholic pancreatitis is considered to be associated with high alcohol consumption. Although the incidence of alcoholic pancreatitis is much higher in men than in women, there is no difference in sexes in the risk involved after adjusting for alcohol intake. Other risk factors include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery, therapeutic drugs, {HIV} infection, hyperlipidemia, and biliary tract anomalies. Idiopathic acute pancreatitis is defined as acute pancreatitis in which the etiological factor cannot be specified. However, several studies have suggested that this entity includes cases caused by other specific disorders such as microlithiasis. Acute pancreatitis is a potentially fatal disease with an overall mortality of 2.1\%–7.8\%. The outcome of acute pancreatitis is determined by two factors that reflect the severity of the illness: organ failure and pancreatic necrosis. About half of the deaths in patients with acute pancreatitis occur within the first 1–2 weeks and are mainly attributable to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome {(MODS).} Depending on patient selection, necrotizing pancreatitis develops in approximately 10\%–20\% of patients and the mortality is high, ranging from 14\% to 25\% of these patients. Infected pancreatic necrosis develops in 30\%–40\% of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and the incidence of {MODS} in such patients is high. The recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis is relatively high: almost half the patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis experience a recurrence. When the gallstones are not treated, the risk of recurrence in gallstone pancreatitis ranges from 32\% to 61\%. After recovering from acute pancreatitis, about one-third to one-half of acute pancreatitis patients develop functional disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and fatty stool; the incidence of chronic pancreatitis after acute pancreatitis ranges from 3\% to 13\%. Nevertheless, many reports have shown that most patients who recover from acute pancreatitis regain good general health and return to their usual daily routine. Some authors have emphasized that endocrine function disorders are a common complication after severe acute pancreatitis has been treated by pancreatic resection.},
