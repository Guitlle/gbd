Renal excretion of unchanged {EACA} accounted for 68\% of its elimination and renal {EACA} clearance averaged 115\% of creatinine clearance. {EACA} antifibrinolytic effect kinetics were also characterized in five of the subjects by the monitoring of clot lysis times in whole blood and platelet-rich plasma. Peak antifibrinolytic effects were observed 15 to 60 min after peak {EACA} plasma concentrations were attained. A model of maximal fibrinolysis inhibition {(Emax)} was used to estimate a half-maximal inhibition {(IC50)} of 63 +/- 19.7 microgram/ml.

Yet learning often fails even when strong evidence is available: common mental models lead to erroneous but self-confirming inferences, allowing harmful beliefs and behaviors to persist and undermining implementation of beneficial policies.

Both catenary and mammillary models were identified, and their predictions for the tracer behavior in nonaccessible pools were evaluated. In all experiments, regardless of the model structure, predictions in the compartment most rapidly exchanging with blood (pool 2) well matched the measured tracer-to-tracee ratio in {TDL.} Furthermore, modeling analysis showed that 90-95\% of the tracer in {TDL} comes from this pool. This supported the physiological identification of a peripheral pool of glucose kinetics as extracellular fluid represented by {TDL} measurements.},

	abstract = {Pharmacokinetic {(PK)} models describe how the concentrations of a drug and its metabolite vary with time. Population {PK} models identify and quantify sources of between-individual variability in observed concentrations. Crucial to this aim is the identification of those covariates (i.e., individual-specific characteristics) responsible for explaining the variability. In this article we discuss how covariate modeling can be carried out for population {PK} models. We argue that the importance of a particular covariate can be discussed only with reference to the specific use for which the model is intended. Covariate modeling is important in population {PK} studies as it aids in determining dosage recommendations for specific covariate-defined populations. We describe a Bayesian predictive procedure that places covariate modeling in the context of dosage determination. In problems such as these it is crucial to incorporate relevant prior information. For covariate selection we extend the approach of George and {McCulloch.} The approaches utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methods are illustrated using population {PK} data from a study of the antibiotic vancomycin in babies. These data are sparse, with just 180 concentrations from 37 babies. Eight covariates are available, from which we construct a covariate model.},

We present a simple generic disease model with incidence, one prevalent state, and case fatality and remission. We derive a set of equations that describes this disease process and allows calculation of the complete epidemiology of a disease given a minimum of three input variables. We give the example of asthma with age-specific prevalence, remission, and mortality as inputs. Outputs are incidence and case fatality, among others.

The Global Burden of Disease methodology described in this paper provides a mechanism for quantifying the health consequences of the years of life lived with disabilities by first estimating the age-sex-specific incidence rates of underlying conditions, and then mapping these to a single disability index which collectively reflects the probability of progressing to a disability, the duration of life lived with the disability, and the approximate severity of the disability in terms of activity restriction. Detailed estimates of the number of disability-adjusted life years {(DALYs)} lived are provided in this paper, for eight geographical regions. The results should be useful to those concerned with planning health services for the disabled and, more particularly, with determining policies to prevent the underlying conditions which give rise to serious disabling sequelae.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To describe a dynamic compartmental simulation model for Botswana and India, developed to identify the best strategies for preventing spread of {HIV/AIDS.}


{METHODS}

The following interventions were considered: a behavioural intervention focused on female sex workers; a conventional programme for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections; a programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission; an antiretroviral treatment programme for the entire population, based on a single regimen; and an antiretroviral treatment programme for sex workers only, also based on a single regimen.


{FINDINGS}

The interventions directed at sex workers as well as those dealing with sexually transmitted infections showed promise for long-term prevention of human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)} infection, although their relative ranking was uncertain. In India, a sex worker intervention would drive the epidemic to extinction. In Botswana none of the interventions alone would achieve this, although the prevalence of {HIV} would be reduced by almost 50\%. Mother-to-child transmission programmes could reduce {HIV} transmission to infants, but would have no impact on the epidemic itself. In the long run, interventions targeting sexual transmission would be even more effective in reducing the number of {HIV-infected} children than mother-to-child transmission programmes. Antiretroviral therapy would prevent transmission in the short term, but eventually its effects would wane because of the development of drug resistance.


{CONCLUSION}

Depending on the country and how the antiretroviral therapy was targeted, 25-100\% of {HIV} cases would be drug- resistant after 30 years of use.},

The model allows one to consider not only effects on the screened women and their newborns, but also effects on the rest of the population. The analysis reveals that the primary benefit of screening programs targeted to women of childbearing age lies not in the prevention of {HIV} infection in their newborns but in the prevention of infection in their adult contacts. We find that screening medium and high risk women is likely to be cost-beneficial. Screening women regardless of risk group may also be cost-beneficial if screened positive women show relatively modest levels of behavioral change, but screening programs that reach primarily low risk women are not likely to be cost-beneficial. The results hold over a broad range of sensitivity analyses of important variables.},

	abstract = {Bordetella pertussis infection remains an important public health problem worldwide despite decades of routine vaccination. A key indicator of the impact of vaccination programmes is the inter-epidemic period, which is expected to increase with vaccine uptake if there is significant herd immunity. Based on empirical data from 64 countries across the five continents over the past 30-70 years, we document the observed relationship between the average inter-epidemic period, birth rate and vaccine coverage. We then use a mathematical model to explore the range of scenarios for duration of immunity and transmission resulting from repeat infections that are consistent with empirical evidence. Estimates of pertussis periodicity ranged between 2 and 4.6 years, with a strong association with susceptible recruitment rate, defined as birth rate × (1 - vaccine coverage). Periodicity increased by 1.27 years on average after the introduction of national vaccination programmes (95\% {CI:} 1.13, 1.41 years), indicative of increased herd immunity. Mathematical models suggest that the observed patterns of pertussis periodicity are equally consistent with loss of immunity that is not as rapid as currently thought, or with negligible transmission generated by repeat infections. We conclude that both vaccine coverage and birth rate drive pertussis periodicity globally and that vaccination induces strong herd immunity effects. A better understanding of the role of repeat infections in pertussis transmission is critical to refine existing control strategies.},

Routinely available clinical observations will be used to predict the parameters of a pharmacokinetic model, and subsequent blood level determinations used to refine these predictions, so that dosages can be designed to produce therapeutically desirable blood levels of agents. The system is intended to deal with most, if not all, of the influences on drug pharmacokinetics, to improve its performance by learning about the individual patient as well as the underlying population, and to modify its suggestions for an individual, should his clinical characteristics change. It may be used to discover new relationships between physiological states and drug pharmacokinetics. The system can exploit prior information in the form of theoretical and published data when its data base is small. An encouraging preliminary test of the system is reported.},

In recent years, many researchers have become aware of the usefulness of these techniques in the experimental design. With this has come the recognition that the discipline of kinetic analysis requires its own expertise. The expertise can impact experimental design in many ways, from the collaborative and service activities in which individuals interact in formal ways to the development of software tools to aid in kinetic analysis. The purpose of this report is to describe one such software tool, Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling Software {II} {(SAAM} {II).} In the first part, we describe in general how the user can take advantage of the capabilities of the software system, and in the second part, we give three specific examples using multicompartmental models found in lipoprotein (apolipoprotein B {[apoB]} kinetics) and diabetes (glucose minimal model) research.},

	abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index {(SCI)} and Social Sciences Citation Index {(SSCI).} Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for {SCI} up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that {SCI} was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by {SCI} is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that {SCI} has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in {SSCI} was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by {SSCI} was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on {SCI}, {SSCI} and Arts and Humanities Citation Index {(AHCI).} Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},
