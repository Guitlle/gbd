Nevertheless, for many diseases in many countries only partial data are available. When the partial data are insufficient, but data collection is not an option, it is possible to supplement the data by exploiting the causal relations between the various variables that describe a disease process. We present a simple generic disease model with incidence, one prevalent state, and case fatality and remission. We derive a set of equations that describes this disease process and allows calculation of the complete epidemiology of a disease given a minimum of three input variables. We give the example of asthma with age-specific prevalence, remission, and mortality as inputs. Outputs are incidence and case fatality, among others. The set of equations is embedded in a software package called {'DisMod} {II'}, which is made available to the public domain by the World Health Organization.},

With this has come the recognition that the discipline of kinetic analysis requires its own expertise. The expertise can impact experimental design in many ways, from the collaborative and service activities in which individuals interact in formal ways to the development of software tools to aid in kinetic analysis. The purpose of this report is to describe one such software tool, Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling Software {II} {(SAAM} {II).} In the first part, we describe in general how the user can take advantage of the capabilities of the software system, and in the second part, we give three specific examples using multicompartmental models found in lipoprotein (apolipoprotein B {[apoB]} kinetics) and diabetes (glucose minimal model) research.},

The model allows one to consider not only effects on the screened women and their newborns, but also effects on the rest of the population. The analysis reveals that the primary benefit of screening programs targeted to women of childbearing age lies not in the prevention of {HIV} infection in their newborns but in the prevention of infection in their adult contacts. We find that screening medium and high risk women is likely to be cost-beneficial. Screening women regardless of risk group may also be cost-beneficial if screened positive women show relatively modest levels of behavioral change, but screening programs that reach primarily low risk women are not likely to be cost-beneficial. The results hold over a broad range of sensitivity analyses of important variables.},

	abstract = {Bordetella pertussis infection remains an important public health problem worldwide despite decades of routine vaccination. A key indicator of the impact of vaccination programmes is the inter-epidemic period, which is expected to increase with vaccine uptake if there is significant herd immunity. Based on empirical data from 64 countries across the five continents over the past 30-70 years, we document the observed relationship between the average inter-epidemic period, birth rate and vaccine coverage. We then use a mathematical model to explore the range of scenarios for duration of immunity and transmission resulting from repeat infections that are consistent with empirical evidence. Estimates of pertussis periodicity ranged between 2 and 4.6 years, with a strong association with susceptible recruitment rate, defined as birth rate Ã (1 - vaccine coverage). Periodicity increased by 1.27 years on average after the introduction of national vaccination programmes (95\% {CI:} 1.13, 1.41 years), indicative of increased herd immunity. Mathematical models suggest that the observed patterns of pertussis periodicity are equally consistent with loss of immunity that is not as rapid as currently thought, or with negligible transmission generated by repeat infections. We conclude that both vaccine coverage and birth rate drive pertussis periodicity globally and that vaccination induces strong herd immunity effects. A better understanding of the role of repeat infections in pertussis transmission is critical to refine existing control strategies.},

Renal excretion of unchanged {EACA} accounted for 68\% of its elimination and renal {EACA} clearance averaged 115\% of creatinine clearance. {EACA} antifibrinolytic effect kinetics were also characterized in five of the subjects by the monitoring of clot lysis times in whole blood and platelet-rich plasma. Peak antifibrinolytic effects were observed 15 to 60 min after peak {EACA} plasma concentrations were attained. A model of maximal fibrinolysis inhibition {(Emax)} was used to estimate a half-maximal inhibition {(IC50)} of 63 +/- 19.7 microgram/ml. This agrees with the value of 0.55 {mM} or 72 microgram/ml that has been reported for the dissociation constant of the {EACA-plasminogen} complex and is consistent with the proposed biochemical mechanism of {EACA} action.},

A bolus of [6,6-{(2)H]glucose} was injected in nine animals, followed by frequent sampling of blood and {TDL.} Linear kinetic modeling has been applied to plasma data, indicating that a three-compartment model adequately describes glucose kinetics. Both catenary and mammillary models were identified, and their predictions for the tracer behavior in nonaccessible pools were evaluated. In all experiments, regardless of the model structure, predictions in the compartment most rapidly exchanging with blood (pool 2) well matched the measured tracer-to-tracee ratio in {TDL.} Furthermore, modeling analysis showed that 90-95\% of the tracer in {TDL} comes from this pool. This supported the physiological identification of a peripheral pool of glucose kinetics as extracellular fluid represented by {TDL} measurements.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15881985},
	abstract = {The objective of this communication is to introduce a conceptual framework for a study that applies a rigorous systems approach to rural disaster preparedness and planning. System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as "what-if" tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions--for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak--some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.},

	abstract = {Pharmacokinetic {(PK)} models describe how the concentrations of a drug and its metabolite vary with time. Population {PK} models identify and quantify sources of between-individual variability in observed concentrations. Crucial to this aim is the identification of those covariates (i.e., individual-specific characteristics) responsible for explaining the variability. In this article we discuss how covariate modeling can be carried out for population {PK} models. We argue that the importance of a particular covariate can be discussed only with reference to the specific use for which the model is intended. Covariate modeling is important in population {PK} studies as it aids in determining dosage recommendations for specific covariate-defined populations. We describe a Bayesian predictive procedure that places covariate modeling in the context of dosage determination. In problems such as these it is crucial to incorporate relevant prior information. For covariate selection we extend the approach of George and {McCulloch.} The approaches utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methods are illustrated using population {PK} data from a study of the antibiotic vancomycin in babies. These data are sparse, with just 180 concentrations from 37 babies. Eight covariates are available, from which we construct a covariate model.},

	abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index {(SCI)} and Social Sciences Citation Index {(SSCI).} Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50Â years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for {SCI} up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that {SCI} was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by {SCI} is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that {SCI} has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in {SSCI} was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by {SSCI} was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on {SCI}, {SSCI} and Arts and Humanities Citation Index {(AHCI).} Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

While this may be relevant for defining the extent and demographic pattern of disabilities in a population, and thus indicating the need for rehabilitative services, prevention requires detailed information on the underlying diseases and injuries that cause disabilities. The Global Burden of Disease methodology described in this paper provides a mechanism for quantifying the health consequences of the years of life lived with disabilities by first estimating the age-sex-specific incidence rates of underlying conditions, and then mapping these to a single disability index which collectively reflects the probability of progressing to a disability, the duration of life lived with the disability, and the approximate severity of the disability in terms of activity restriction. Detailed estimates of the number of disability-adjusted life years {(DALYs)} lived are provided in this paper, for eight geographical regions. The results should be useful to those concerned with planning health services for the disabled and, more particularly, with determining policies to prevent the underlying conditions which give rise to serious disabling sequelae.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To describe a dynamic compartmental simulation model for Botswana and India, developed to identify the best strategies for preventing spread of {HIV/AIDS.}


{METHODS}

The following interventions were considered: a behavioural intervention focused on female sex workers; a conventional programme for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections; a programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission; an antiretroviral treatment programme for the entire population, based on a single regimen; and an antiretroviral treatment programme for sex workers only, also based on a single regimen.


{FINDINGS}

The interventions directed at sex workers as well as those dealing with sexually transmitted infections showed promise for long-term prevention of human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)} infection, although their relative ranking was uncertain. In India, a sex worker intervention would drive the epidemic to extinction. In Botswana none of the interventions alone would achieve this, although the prevalence of {HIV} would be reduced by almost 50\%. Mother-to-child transmission programmes could reduce {HIV} transmission to infants, but would have no impact on the epidemic itself. In the long run, interventions targeting sexual transmission would be even more effective in reducing the number of {HIV-infected} children than mother-to-child transmission programmes. Antiretroviral therapy would prevent transmission in the short term, but eventually its effects would wane because of the development of drug resistance.


{CONCLUSION}

Depending on the country and how the antiretroviral therapy was targeted, 25-100\% of {HIV} cases would be drug- resistant after 30 years of use.},

	abstract = {For decades, researchers have noted systematic shifts in cause-of-death patterns as mortality levels change. The notion of the âepidemiologic transitionâ has influenced thinking about the evolution of health in different societies and the response of the health system to these changes. This article re-examines the epidemiologic transition in terms of empirical regularities in the cause composition of mortality by age and sex since 1950, and considers whether the theory of epidemiologic transition presents a durable framework for understanding more recent patterns. Age-sex-specific mortality rates from three broad cause groups are analyzed: Group 1 (communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal causes, and nutritional deficiencies); Group 2 (noncommunicable diseases); and Group 3 (injuries), using the most extensive international database on mortality by cause, including 1,576 country-years of observation, and new statistical models for compositional data. The analyses relate changes in cause-of-death patterns to changing levels of all-cause mortality and income per capita. The results confirm that declines in overall mortality are accompanied by systematic changes in the composition of causes in many age groups. These changes are most pronounced among children, for whom Group 1 causes decline as overall mortality falls, and in younger adults, where strikingly different patterns are found for men (shift from Group 3 to Group 2) compared to women (shift toward Group 2 then Group 3). The underlying patterns that emerge from this analysis offer insights into the epidemiologic transition from high-mortality to low-mortality settings.},

Yet learning often fails even when strong evidence is available: common mental models lead to erroneous but self-confirming inferences, allowing harmful beliefs and behaviors to persist and undermining implementation of beneficial policies.

The application of simulation in health services is reviewed. A comparison is made between the {SD} and traditional simulation approaches and is illustrated by considering reductions in waiting times for coronary heart disease treatment. Traditionally, simulation studies have tended to focus on the analysis of localized decisions and therefore on problems orientated towards individual patients. Although these methods are extremely powerful and effective, there is scope for an alternative modelling approach which is based on a more holistic perspective; {SD} is one such approach. It can assist in the design of robust policies by supporting debate on how the underlying structure might influence the evolutionary behaviour of a system. Using this method we can consider the time variation both of tangibles, such as waiting times and health care costs, and intangibles, such as patient anxiety and the effects of various pressures on purchasing decisions. We propose that {SD} holds great potential in assisting policy formation in health care.},

Studies were included if they reported relative risks {(RRs)} and corresponding 95\% confidence interval {(CI)} of {CHD} with respect to frequency of fruit and vegetable intake. Twelve studies, consisting of 13 independent cohorts, met the inclusion criteria. There were 278,459 individuals (9143 {CHD} events) with a median follow-up of 11 years.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} infection is associated with chronic progressive liver disease. Its global epidemiology is still not well ascertained and its impact will be confronted with a higher burden in the next decade. Aim: The goal of this study was to develop a tool that can be used to predict the future prevalence of the disease in different countries and, more importantly, to understand the cause and effect relationship between the key assumptions and future trends.


{METHODS}

A system approach was used to build a simulation model where each population was modeled with the appropriate inflows and outflows. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the key drivers of future prevalence.


{RESULTS}

The total {HCV-infected} population in the {US} was estimated to decline 24\% from 3.15 million in 2005 to 2.47 million in 2021, while disease burden will increase as the remaining infected population ages. During the same period, the mortality rate was forecasted to increase from 2.1 to 3.1\%. The diagnosed population was 50\% of the total infections, while less than 2\% of the total infections were treated.


{CONCLUSION}

We have created a framework to evaluate the {HCV-infected} populations in countries around the world. This model may help assess the impact of policies to meet the challenges predicted by the evolution of {HCV} infection and disease. This prediction tool may help to target new public health strategies.},

	abstract = {Cirrhosis represents the end stage of any chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C and alcohol are currently the main causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Although initially cirrhosis is compensated, it eventually becomes decompensated, as defined by the presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and/or jaundice. These management recommendations are divided according to the status, compensated or decompensated, of the cirrhotic patient, with a separate section for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatocellular carcinoma {(HCC)}, as this applies to patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In the compensated patient, the main objective is to prevent variceal hemorrhage and any practice that could lead to decompensation. In the decompensated patient, acute variceal hemorrhage and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are severe complications that require hospitalization. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a severe complication of cirrhosis but one that usually occurs in patients who are already in the hospital and, as it represents an extreme of the hemodynamic alterations that lead to ascites formation, it is placed under treatment of ascites. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of the complications of cirrhosis have allowed for a more rational management of cirrhosis and also for the stratification of patients into different risk groups that require different management. These recommendations are based on evidence in the literature, mainly from randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses of these trials. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and consensus conferences with involvement of recognized experts. A rational management of cirrhosis will result in improvements in quality of life, treatment adherence, and, ultimately, in outcomes.},

	abstract = {This review has focused on the prevalence and risk factors associated with knee and hip osteoarthritis. Risk factors for knee osteoarthritis are obesity and major injury, and knee osteoarthritis probably fits into the generalized osteoarthritis diathesis. Repetitive use, such as in jobs requiring heavy labor and knee bending, probably increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Hip osteoarthritis is probably frequently secondary to developmental defects. As Rothman (182) has pointed out in discussing causation, this does not necessarily mean that the same factors do not also contribute to causing hip osteoarthritis. Yet, it appears that, in many cases, developmental defects are severe enough to be sufficient causes of hip osteoarthritis. To delineate other causes, it may be necessary to examine risk factors separately in those with and in those without developmental disease. Although large epidemiologic studies are best able to identify the relative contributions of specific risk factors while controlling for other risk factors, new studies need to focus on important unresolved questions. First, longitudinal studies with comprehensive follow-up using repeated radiographic assessments are needed to identify factors that cause development of disease or the onset of symptoms. Second, cohorts with early and possibly asymptomatic disease need to be followed to determine the causes of progression or regression of disease and the natural history of disease. Such cohorts may include those at high risk of injury such as sports enthusiasts or manual laborers.},

Epidemiologic information is important to inform etiological research and service delivery planning. However, current information on the epidemiology of alcohol use disorders in the United States is lacking.


{OBJECTIVES}

To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, and treatment of {DSM-IV} alcohol abuse and dependence. Design, Setting, and


{PARTICIPANTS}

Face-to-face interviews with a representative {US} adult sample {(N} = 43 093).


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Lifetime and 12-month {DSM-IV} alcohol abuse and dependence.


{RESULTS}

Prevalence of lifetime and 12-month alcohol abuse was 17.8\% and 4.7\%; prevalence of lifetime and 12-month alcohol dependence was 12.5\% and 3.8\%. Alcohol dependence was significantly more prevalent among men, whites, Native Americans, younger and unmarried adults, and those with lower incomes. Current alcohol abuse was more prevalent among men, whites, and younger and unmarried individuals while lifetime rates were highest among middle-aged Americans. Significant disability was particularly associated with alcohol dependence. Only 24.1\% of those with alcohol dependence were ever treated, slightly less than the treatment rate found 10 years earlier. Strong associations between other substance use disorders and alcohol use disorders (odds ratios, 2.0-18.7) were lower but remained strong and significant (odds ratios, 1.8-7.5) when controlling for other comorbidity. Significant associations between mood, anxiety, and personality disorders and alcohol dependence (odds ratios, 2.1-4.8) were reduced in number and magnitude (odds ratios, 1.5-2.0) when controlling for other comorbidity.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Alcohol abuse and dependence remain highly prevalent and disabling. Comorbidity of alcohol dependence with other substance disorders appears due in part to unique factors underlying etiology for each pair of disorders studied while comorbidity of alcohol dependence with mood, anxiety, and personality disorders appears more attributable to factors shared among these other disorders. Persistent low treatment rates given the availability of effective treatments indicate the need for vigorous education efforts for the public and professionals.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} accounts for approximately 20\% of cases of acute hepatitis, 70\% of chronic hepatitis, and 30\% of end-stage liver disease in the United States. The acute infection has an incubation period of 7 weeks (range, 4-20 weeks) and is symptomatic and icteric in only one third of patients. Serum aminotransferase levels generally increase greater than 10-fold elevated and as symptoms and signs resolve decrease into the normal range. Antibody to {HCV} is usually but not always present at the time of onset of symptoms. {HCV} {RNA} appears in the serum early during the incubation period, increases in titer and peaks at the time of symptoms, and then disappears in resolving disease. Importantly, 85\% of patients with acute {HCV} infection develop chronic infection. In these patients, {HCV} {RNA} remains present and in approximately two thirds of patients, aminotransferases remain elevated in the range of 1.5- to 10-fold the upper limit of normal. The course of chronic hepatitis C is variable. Probably fewer than 20\% of patients have symptoms and they are usually intermittent, vague, and nonspecific, largely being malaise and easy fatiguability. A small percentage of patients develop extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C, including cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis. It is estimated that 20\% to 30\% of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, but the process is generally slow and insidious. Once cirrhosis develops, symptoms are more common and the signs of end-stage liver disease can appear with jaundice, weakness, wasting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cirrhosis are also at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, this important liver disease has protean manifestations but is often insidious and can lead to end-stage liver disease despite the presence of few symptoms and signs of illness.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To determine the incidence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis {(OA)} and symptomatic {OA} (symptoms plus radiographic {OA)}, as well as the rate of progression of preexisting radiographic {OA} in a population-based sample of elderly persons.


{METHODS}

Framingham Osteoarthritis Study subjects who had knee radiographs and had answered questions about knee symptoms in 1983-1985 were reexamined in 1992-1993 (mean 8.1-year interval) using the same protocol. Subjects were defined as having new (incident) radiographic {OA} if they developed grade {\textgreater} or = 2 {OA} (at least definite osteophytes or definite joint space narrowing). New symptomatic {OA} was present if subjects developed a combination of knee symptoms and grade {\textgreater} or = 2 {OA.} Progressive {OA} was diagnosed when radiographs showing grade 2 disease at baseline showed grade {\textgreater} or = 3 disease on followup.


{RESULTS}

Of 1,438 participants in the original study, 387 (26.9\%) died prior to followup. Of the 1,051 surviving subjects, 869 (82.7\%) participated in the followup study (mean +/- {SD} age 70.8 +/- 5.0 at baseline). Rates of incident disease were 1.7 times higher in women than in men (95\% confidence interval {[CI]} 1.0-2.7), and progressive disease occurred slightly more often in women (relative risk = 1.4; 95\% {CI} 0.8-2.5) but rates did not vary by age in this sample. Among women, approximately 2\% per year developed incident radiographic disease, 1\% per year developed symptomatic knee {OA}, and about 4\% per year experienced progressive knee {OA.}


{CONCLUSION}

In elderly persons, the new onset of knee {OA} is frequent and is more common in women than men. However, among the elderly, age may not affect new disease occurrence or progression.},

From the 1950s until the 1980s, the Egyptian Ministry of Health {(MOH)} undertook large control campaigns using intravenous tartar emetic, the standard treatment for schistosomiasis, as community-wide therapy. This commendable effort to control a major health problem unfortunately established a very large reservoir of hepatitis C virus {(HCV)} in the country. By the mid-1980s, the effective oral drug, praziquantel, replaced tartar emetic a s treatment f o r schistosomiasis in the entire country. This both reduced schistosomal transmission and disease and interrupted the "occult" {HCV} epidemic. It was evident when diagnostic serology became available in the 1990s that {HCV} had replaced schistosomiasis as the predominant cause of chronic liver disease. Epidemiological studies reported a high prevalence and incidence of {HCV}, particutarly within families in rural areas endemic for schistosomiasis. Clinical studies showed 70\% to 90\% of patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma had {HCV} infections. Co-infections with schistosomiasis caused more severe liver disease than infection with {HCV} alone. Schistosomiasis was reported to cause an imbalance in {HCV-specific} T-cell responses leading to increased viral load, a higher probability of {HCV} chronicity, and more rapid progression of complications in co-infected persons. As complications of {HCV} usually occur after 20 years of infection, the peak impact of the Egyptian outbreak has not yet occurred. Efforts have been initiated by the Egyptian {MOH} to prevent new infections and complications of {HCV} in the estimated 6 million infected persons.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

The symptomatology of cannabis dependence remains ill-defined and its importance controversial. Compared with alcohol dependence, the symptom profile of cannabis dependence has received little attention. We aimed to (a) report cannabis use in a representative population of young adults, (b) examine cannabis dependence symptoms according to frequency in the dependence syndrome and (c) contrast the symptomatology of cannabis and alcohol syndromes.


{METHODS}

1601 young adults (mean age 20.7 years) from an Australian longitudinal cohort study {(N=2032)} were surveyed in 1998. Regular substance users were assessed for {DSM-IV} cannabis and alcohol dependence. Prevalence estimates allowed for sampling variation and attrition.


{RESULTS}

Fifty-nine per cent reported life-time use of cannabis, 17\% used at least weekly and 7\% (11\% males, 4\% females) met criteria for cannabis dependence. Symptom prevalence in dependent cannabis users was: persistent desire 91\%; unintentional use 84\%; withdrawal 74\%; excessive time obtaining/using 74\%; continued use despite health problems 63\%; tolerance 21\%; and social consequences 18\%. The combination of withdrawal, persistent desire and unintentional use was reported by 57\%. Dependent cannabis users reported compulsive and out-of-control use more frequently than dependent alcohol users, withdrawal similarly and tolerance considerably less often.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Cannabis use appears to be normative behaviour in young Australians. Progression beyond weekly use of cannabis carries a significant risk of dependence that should be considered in the public health response. The differing profiles of cannabis and alcohol dependence, particularly with regard to craving, draws attention to the need for further study of cannabis dependence as an important and distinct disorder in young adults.},

	abstract = {Although Parkinson's disease {(PD)} is the only chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are effective symptomatic therapies no treatment has yet been identified that would significantly slow its natural progression. Studies into the natural history of Parkinson's disease have been complicated by issues of diagnostic accuracy, heterogeneity of different forms of the disease as well as confounding effects of age related comorbidities. Only recently results from placebo-controlled clinical trials have helped to define the rates of progression of motor dysfunction as assessed by the {UPDRS} in early {PD.} Studies in treated patients suggest that there may be different rates of progression in different phases of the disease with faster decline in earlier versus later stages. Measuring progression of motor symptoms, however, alone is insufficient to describe the natural history of {PD} and may also be inadequate to define clinically meaningful disease modification in intervention trials. Progression of global disability as captured in the Hoehn and Yahr scale is important to consider and progression to stage {III} with beginning postural impairment defines a major milestone in the natural history of this illness. In addition, non-motor symptoms have major impact on the natural history of {PD.} Dementia, sleep-wake cycle dysregulation and autonomic failure were present in 50-80\% of patients in one recent 15 year-follow up study. Dementia and psychosis are also major risk factors for nursing home placement in {PD.} A prerequisite for effective interventions that would modify disease progression in Parkinson's disease is the identification of the earliest preclinical stages of illness. This is now become a realistic possibility with screening tests of olfactory function and subsequent functional imaging. Subjects at risk for Parkinson's disease should be the future focus of neuroprotective trials.},

Almost a century later, many features of leishmaniasis and its major syndromes (ie, visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal) have remained the same; but also much has changed. As before, epidemics of this sandfly-borne disease occur periodically in India and elsewhere; but leishmaniasis has also emerged in new regions and settings, for example, as an {AIDS-associated} opportunistic infection. Diagnosis still typically relies on classic microbiological methods, but molecular-based approaches are being tested. Pentavalent antimony compounds have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for half a century, but lipid formulations of amphotericin B (though expensive and administered parenterally) represent a major advance for treating visceral leishmaniasis. A pressing need is for the technological advances in the understanding of the immune response to leishmania and the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis to be translated into field-applicable and affordable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease.},

Women with more severe affective symptoms are classified as having premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although the etiology of these disorders remains uncertain, research suggests that altered regulation of neurohormones and neurotransmitters is involved. Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder are diagnoses of exclusion; therefore, alternative explanations for symptoms must be considered before either diagnosis is made. The disorders can manifest with a wide variety of symptoms, including depression, mood lability, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, headache, and fatigue. Women with mild symptoms should be instructed about lifestyle changes, including healthy diet, sodium and caffeine restriction, exercise, and stress reduction. Supportive strategies, such as use of a symptom diary, may be helpful in diagnosing and managing the disorders. In women with moderate symptoms, treatment includes both medication and lifestyle modifications. Dietary supplements, such as calcium and evening primrose oil, may offer modest benefit. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline are the most effective pharmacologic agents. Prostaglandin inhibitors and diuretics may provide some relief of symptoms. Only weak evidence supports the effectiveness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, androgenic agents, estrogen, progesterone, or other psychotropics, and side effects limit their use.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The population of Egypt has a heavy burden of liver disease, mostly due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus {(HCV).} Overall prevalence of antibody to {HCV} in the general population is around 15-20\%. The risk factor for {HCV} transmission that specifically sets Egypt apart from other countries is a personal history of parenteral antischistosomal therapy {(PAT).} A review of the Egyptian {PAT} mass-treatment campaigns, discontinued only in the 1980s, show a very high potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. We examine the relative importance of {PAT} in the spread of {HCV} in Egypt.


{METHODS}

The degree of exposure to {PAT} by cohort was estimated from 1961-86 Ministry of Health data. A cohort-specific exposure index for {PAT} was calculated and compared with cohort-specific {HCV} prevalence rates in four regions.


{FINDINGS}

{HCV} prevalence was calculated for 8499 Egyptians aged 10-50 years. A significant association between seroprevalence of antibodies to {HCV} and the exposure index (1.31 [95\% {CI} 1.08-1.59]; p=0.007) was identified across four different regions. In all regions cohort-specific {HCV} prevalence was lowest in children and young adults than in older cohorts. These lower prevalence rates coincided with the gradual and final replacement of {PAT} with oral antischistosomal drugs at different points in time in the four regions.


{INTERPRETATION}

The data suggest that {PAT} had a major role in the spread of {HCV} throughout Egypt. This intensive transmission established a large reservoir of chronic {HCV} infection, responsible for the high prevalence of {HCV} infection and current high rates of transmission. Egypt's mass campaigns of {PAT} may represent the world's largest iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {The family Trypanosomatidae consists of many parasitic flagellate protozoans. Two genera, Trypanosoma and Leishmania, include important pathogens of humans and domestic animals. The diseases caused by these protozoa are endemic or enzootic in different parts of the world and constitute serious medical and economic problems. Because these protozoans require hematin obtained from blood hemoglobin for aerobic respiration, they are called hemoflagellates. The digenetic (two-host) life cycles of both genera involve an insect and a vertebrate. The family also includes the digenetic genus Phytomonas, which infects plants, and some monogenetic (one-host) species which infect only invertebrate hosts. The hemoflagellates have up to eight life cycle stages which differ in the placement and origin of the flagellum. Two stagesâthe amastigote and the trypomastigoteâmay occur in vertebrate hosts, and three stages,âthe promastigote, paramastigote, and epimastigoteâin invertebrate hosts {(Fig.} 82-1). Besides the nucleus and the flagellum, a trypanosomatic cell has a unique organelle called the kinetoplast. The kinetoplast appears to be a special part of the mitochondrion and is rich in {DNA.} Two types of {DNA} molecules, maxicircles which encode mainly certain important mitochondrial enzymes, and minicircles which serve a function in the processof {RNA} editing, have been found in the kinetoplast; when Giemsa stained, the kinetoplast is reddish purple and darker than the nucleus, contrasting with the pale blue cytoplasm. Monogenetic trypanosomatids are more primitive than the digenetic species and grow easily in synthetic culture media. Some digenetic species can be cultivated in complex synthetic media. The medium most commonly used is {NNN} medium, which has a solid phase of rabbit blood agar and a liquid phase of a physiologic salt solution. Liquid media are also available. Only the invertebrate stages appear in such media, and they may or may not be infectious for the vertebrate hosts, depending on the species. Replication of trypanosomatids occurs by single or multiple fission, involving first the kinetoplast, then the nucleus, and finally the cytoplasm. However, evidence for sexual reproduction has been presented.},

Bipolar disorder has always been highly recurrent and considered to have a poor prognosis. Bipolar patients who have been hospitalized spend about 20\% of their lifetime from the onset of their disorder in episodes. Fifty percent of bipolar episodes last between 2 and 7 months (median 3 months). The intervals between the first few episodes tend to shorten; later the episodes return at an irregular rhythm of about 0.4 episodes per year with high interindividual variability. Switches from mania into mild depression and from depression into hypomania were frequently reported in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Antidepressant and antimanic drugs have to be given as long as the natural episode lasts. Given the poor outcome of bipolar disorders found in naturalistic follow-up studies and our lifelong investigation, intensive antidepressant, antimanic, and mood-stabilizing treatments are required in most cases. Despite modern treatments the outcome into old age is still poor, full recovery without further episodes rare, recurrence of episodes with incomplete remission the rule, and the development of chronicity and suicide still frequent.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Premenstrual syndrome is believed to affect 30\% to 80\% of women. Studies in various cultures have used a variety of methodologies to determine prevalence, symptom profile, and effectiveness of available treatments. This study was designed to provide information on incidence of {PMS} and therapies used based on a national probability sample of {US} women.


{METHOD}

In 1996 a national probability sample {(N} = 1052) of women aged 21 to 64 years was surveyed by telephone using random digit dial methods. The survey included demographic information, questions concerning respondent knowledge of premenstrual syndrome, incidence rates of common premenstrual syndrome symptoms, and any remedies that were used to control the symptoms.


{RESULTS}

Forty-one percent of the women responded "yes" to the question, {"Do} you suffer from premenstrual syndrome?" An additional 17\% indicated that they experienced symptoms prior to their menstrual cycle that are commonly associated with premenstrual syndrome (e.g., pain, bloating, feeling more emotional, weight gain, food cravings), though without associating these symptoms with premenstrual syndrome explicity. The most frequently noted severe symptom was that of "[feeling] more emotional." Of those reporting premenstrual syndrome symptoms, approximately 42\% took either prescription or over-the-counter medications to relieve them. Eighty percent of the women taking any type of medication relied on over-the-counter medications. Prescription drug use for premenstrual syndrome symptoms focused on medications to control pain; hormone supplements were the second most frequently prescribed rugs. Fewer than 3\% of the respondents used prescription medications. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they had used a complementary medical therapy to control symptoms. Exercise was used most frequently (18\%), and acupuncture was the least frequently used. Although only a small percentage of women used complementary therapies, for most of these therapies a near-perfect concordance was found between usage and belief in efficacy.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Women were aware of symptoms related to premenstrual syndrome more frequently than they recognized a formalized medical syndrome. Less than half of the women reporting symptoms had taken either over-the-counter or prescription drugs. Those who tried complementary therapies generally found them to be effective.},

In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

{ABSTRACT:}


{BACKGROUND}

Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally; yet the overall burden of diarrhea in terms of duration and severity has not been quantified. As improvements in treatment lead to decreases in diarrhea mortality, it is important to understand the substantial impact of diarrhea morbidity on disability among children and adults worldwide.


{METHODS}

We conducted a systematic review to generate estimates of duration and severity outcomes for individuals 0-59 mos, 5-15 yrs, and â¥ 16 yrs, and for 3 severity indexes: mild, moderate, and severe.


{RESULTS}

We estimate that among children under-five, 64.8\% of diarrheal episodes are mild, 34.7\% are moderate, and 0.5\% are severe. On average, mild episodes last 4.3 days, and severe episodes last 8.4 days and cause dehydration in 84.6\% of cases. We estimate that among older children and adults, 95\% of episodes are mild; 4.95\% are moderate; and 0.05\% are severe. Among individuals â¥ 16 yrs, severe episodes typically last 2.6 days and cause dehydration in 92.8\% of cases.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Moderate and severe episodes constitute a substantial portion of the total envelope of diarrhea among children under-five (35.2\%; about 588 million episodes). Among older children and adults, moderate and severe episodes account for a much smaller proportion of the total envelope of diarrhea (5\%), but the absolute number of such episodes is noteworthy (about 21.5 million episodes among individuals â¥ 16 yrs). Hence, the global burden of diarrhea consists of significant morbidity, extending beyond episodes progressing to death.},
