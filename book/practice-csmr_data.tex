\section{Diseases with cause-specific mortality data}

TK diseases where there the excess-mortality for people with the
disease shows up as a certain ICD code on the death certificates.

TK diseases where excess-mortality exceeds f_ICD, but this is a lower
bound, and still the most relevant source of information.

Cause-specific mortality rates are not fundamental rates in the system
dynamics model from Chapter [ref TK]. They are measurements of a lower
bound on the prevalence times the excess-mortality rate. Nonetheless,
they can be informative information. TK figure showing how different
prevalence levels and excess-mortality levels can lead to the same
cause-specific mortality rate.
