\chapter{Overlapping, heterogeneous age groups: atrial fibrillation}
\label{applications-age_groups}

Studies often present epidemiologic parameter data aggregated 
over age spans of epidemiologic interest.  However, research 
for some diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), have no 
standard set of age groups for study.  Therefore systematic review on
the descriptive epidemiology parameters of AF yields overlapping 
and heterogeneous age groups, making it necessary for the meta analysis
to use age group modeling.

AF is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia.
Chaotic and irregular heart rhythms originating in the atria cause
poor blood flow to the body.  The duration of AF episodes vary greatly.
First attacks or paroxysmal AF are occasional, only lasting a few minutes 
or hours, whereas persistent AF and permanent AF are chronic. 
Symptoms include heart palpitations,
lack of energy, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest discomfort,
although some cases of atrial fibrillation are symptomless.  AF
may occur at any age with increasing risk for older ages.
It is uncommon in children.  Other heart diseases tend to be the underlying
cause of AF.  AF is associated with with coronary heart disease, 
hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, 
cardiomyopathy, obesity and metabolic disorders such as diabetes 
and hyperthyroidism. \cite{rich_epidemiology_2009,

The GBD 2010 Study defines AF as a patient having a least one episode
confirmed by a physician.  In Western Europe, $229$ data
points met the inclusion criteria.  As seen from Figure \ref{fig:app-af data}, 
AF has heterogeneous and overlapping age groups.  Without
access to the microdata needed to recreate homogeneous age groups, combining all of this data must rely on age group modeling, as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:age_group_model}.

As discussed in Chapter \ref{theory-age_group_model-overlapping_data},
the simplest approach to modeling heterogeneous age groups is to apply
each age-specific rate measurement to the midpoint of the age interval.
Another solution to the heterogeneous age groups is to use age-standardizing.
Age-standardizing adds age-weights to the age-specific rate according
to population structure.  The age-standardizing model uses a common
age pattern for all studies so that the age-weights are the same for
all age groups, as discussed in more detail in Chapter
\ref{theory-age_group_model-overlapping_data}.

As the prevalence estimates in Figure \ref{fig:app-af srt p} show, model
choice matters.  While the midpoint and age-standardizing spline models produce
similar estimates for younger ages, the estimates for the oldest age groups
differ in magnitude and trend.

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{af-mp_v_hetero_srt_p.pdf}

              prevalence estimates for Western European

              and panel (b) the data and estimates from the midpoint spline model.}
            \label{fig:app-af srt p}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Without additional information, one cannot say which model is correct.
Further investigation with incidence does not provide much insight.  Like
the prevalence estimates, Figure \ref{fig:app-af srt i} shows that the
incidence estimates are similar in younger ages, but are markedly different
in older ages.  The age-standardizing spline model does produce estimates with a
smoother age pattern.

Using of all available data in a compartmental model, including the
limited available data on excess mortality, with-condition mortality
and cause-specific mortality, could inform the model choice.
A compartmental model simultaneously estimates all parameters to
maintain internal consistency.  Compartmental models are discussed
in more discussed in more detail in Chapters \ref{sys-dynamics}.
Figure \ref{fig:app-af age-stand} shows prevalence and incidence estimates
from the age-standardizing compartmental.

The compartmental model estimates from Figure \ref{fig:app-af age-stand}
are very different from the spline model estimates, especially for incidence.
Unlike the spline models, the compartmental model estimates for
incidence do not go through the data exactly.  This is because the compartmental model
requires internal consistency, i.e. for every prevalent case there must be
a matching incident event.  The compartmental model shows that these levels
of prevalence cannot be achieved with the levels of incidence that the data show.

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:app-af compare} compares the age-standardizing compartmental
model to the midpoint compartmental model.  Like the spline models,
the prevalence estimates only differ in the oldest ages.  However, the
incidence of the two models is very different.  The age-standardizing model
has an earlier age of onset and decline than the midpoint model.

Choice of age group model has implications for disease estimates.  Estimated age pattern, trends and levels can differ between the midpoint and age-standardizing models.  TK better conclusion.
