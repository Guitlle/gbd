\section{ Diseases where mortality is not a constant hazard}

TK A discussion of the two-stage modeling approach taken in GBS,
Stroke, and other diseases where there is an initial acute phase with
high mortality and then subsequent phase with significantly reduced
mortality.

TK A discussion of how this would play out for a disease like cancer,
where the hazard increases as the case goes on.

TK A discussion of how a generalized framework could allow additional
boxes to take this into account.
