\section{A motivating example: Parkinson's Disease}
\label{intro-complete_ex}

As a motivating example, we now turn to the descriptive
epidemiological meta-regression of Parkinson's Disease (PD). A
systematic review of PD was conducted as part of the GBD 2010
Study.\cite{GBD_2010_or_parkinsons_paper} The results of this review,
data on the prevalence, incidence, and standardized mortality ratio of PD
needed to be combined to produce estimates of disease prevalence by
region, age, sex, and year.  These prevalence estimates were combined
with disability weights to measure Years Lived with Disability (YLDs),
which were then combined with estimates of Years of Life Lost (YLLs)
to produce estimates of the burden of PD quantified in disability
adjusted life-year (DALYs).

PD is a neurodegenerative disorder which includes symptoms of motor
dysfunction, such as tremors, rigidity, and akinesia, in the early
stages of the disease.  As the disease develops, most patients also
develop non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline, dementia,
autonomic failure and disordered sleep-wake regulation.  The standard
definition for PD diagnosis includes at least two of four cardinal
signs--resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural abnormalities.
There is no cure and no known treatments to slow the progression of the disease,
however, motor symptoms and disability may be improved with
symptomatic therapy.\cite{poewe_natural_2006, pollock_prevalence_1966, larsen_clinical_1994}

Systematic review for PD yielded $782$ data points total: $660$
prevalence, $99$ incidence, and $13$ standardized mortality ratio data
points that met the inclusion criteria.  A separate analysis of
mortality due to PD was carried out as part of the GBD study and
provided $1638$ additional data points of cause-specific mortality by
region, age and sex for the years 1990, 2005 and 2010.  It is
important to note that in this example, cause-specific mortality means
that the physician issuing a death certificate deemed the person to
have died \emph{from} the disease as the underlying cause and not
simply \emph{with} it.  This subtle distinction is elaborated on in
Chapter~\ref{theory-csmr} and demonstrated further
Chapter~\ref{applications-csmr}.  Even when restricting the data to a
specific geographic region, such as Western Europe, the data remain
noisy and heterogeneous, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:intro-parkinsons
  data}. This figure shows a horizontal bar for each data point, where
the left and right endpoints depict the start and end ages of the age
interval measured, and the height of the bar depicts the value of the
measurement. Chapters~\ref{theory-age_group_model-overlapping_data}
and~\ref{applications-age_groups} describe our approach to making
robust estimates in the face of such heterogeneous levels and
overlapping age groups.

              cause-specific mortality, and (d) standardized mortality
              ratio.}

Including data from 1961-2010, the data points represent the results
of many different studies conducted for many different reasons.  Study
level fixed effects, discussed in Chapters
\ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and
\ref{applications-efx_study_level}, aid the model in explaining bias
resulting from differing diagnostic criteria and study populations.
The model finds no bias associated with subnational studies (as
compared to national studies), estimating that they are shifted in
log-space by $-0.03$ on average, with a 95\% uncertainty interval (UI)
$[-1.1, 1.2]$.  Similarly, studies that do not use a neurologist were
estimates to be shifted in log-space by $0.02$ with UI $[-0.3, 0.3]$.
Studies that used a non-standard definition for PD diagnosis, on the
other hand, were found to be systematically biased to lower levels of
prevalence, compared to a standard definition. The effect coefficient
for the shift in log-space was estimated with a mean of $-0.48$ and UI
$[-0.7, -0.2]$.

Of the $21$ regions reported in the GBD 2010 study, only $36$ countries
from $16$ regions are represented in the systematic review.  The GBD
2010 study predicts year-age-sex estimates for all countries, even
those without data.  To predict out-of-sample, country level fixed
effects, as described in Chapters \ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and
\ref{applications-efx_country_level}, provide a solution to this
problem of missing epidemiological data.  PD uses the
kilocalories of stimulants consumed per capita per day and national smoking prevalence
as country level covariates.

Nonsampling variation that cannot be explained is another problem with
such noisy and heterogeneous data.  Chapters
\ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and \ref{applications-rfx} explain how
random effects can be used to detect systematic differences among
different hierarchies of data.

It is intuitive that there is a relationship between these
epidemiological parameters: every prevalent case was once an incident
case, for example.  Combining all parameters to produce internally
consistent results is discussed in detail in Chapter
\ref{sys-dynamics}.  Through the process of data confrontation
discussed in the following chapters, the meta-analysis produces a best
estimate and uncertainty bounds of disease prevalence, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:intro-parkinsons fit}.

              disease in Western European females in 2005.}
