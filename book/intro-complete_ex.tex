\section{A motivating example: Parkinson's Disease}
\label{intro-complete_ex}

As a motivating example, we now turn to the descriptive
epidemiological meta-regression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) conducted
as part of the GBD 2010 Study.  This provides estimates of the
disability adjusted life-year (DALYs) due to PD, a summary measurement
of disease burden.  DALYs combine estimates of the mortality
\emph{and} morbidity of disease, and it is estimating the morbidity
component, quantified as years lived with disability (YLDs), which
requires an estimate of age-specific disease prevalence in the GBD
2010 Study.

PD is a neurodegenerative disorder which includes symptoms of motor
dysfunction, such as tremors, rigidity, and akinesia, in the early
stages of the disease.  As the disease develops, most patients also
develop non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline, dementia,
autonomic failure and disordered sleep-wake regulation.  There is no
cure and no known treatments to slow the progression of the disease,
however, motor symptoms and disability may be improved with
symptomatic therapy.\cite{poewe_natural_2006, pollock_prevalence_1966}

Systematic review for PD yielded TK data points total: 660 prevalence,
99 incidence, 1638 cause-specific mortality rate and 13 standardized
mortality ratio data points that met the inclusion criteria.  It is
important to note that in this example, cause-specific mortality means
that patients die \emph{with} the disease and not necessarily
\emph{of} it.  This distinction is elaborated on in Chapter
\ref{theory-csmr} and demonstrated further Chapter
\ref{applications-csmr}.  Even when restricting the data to a specific
geographic region, such as Western Europe, the data remain noisy and
heterogeneous, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:intro-parkinsons
  data}. Chapters \ref{theory-age_group_model-overlapping_data} and
\ref{applications-age_groups} describe our approach to making robust
estimates in the face of such heterogeneous levels and overlapping age
groups.

              prevalence (panel (a)), incidence (panel (b)),
              cause-specific mortality (panel (c)) and the
              standardized mortality ratio (panel (d)) of Parkinson's
              disease in Western European females in 2005.}

Including data from 1961-2010, the data points represent the results
of many different studies conducted for many different reasons.  Study
level fixed effects, discussed in Chapters
\ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and
\ref{applications-efx_study_level}, aid the model in explaining bias
resulting from differing diagnostic criteria and study populations. TK
specific example.

Of the 21 regions reported in the GBD 2010 study, only 36 countries
from 12 regions are represented in the systematic review.  The GBD
2010 study predicts year-age-sex estimates for all countries, even
those without data.  To predict out-of-sample, country level fixed
effects, as described in Chapters \ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and
\ref{applications-efx_country_level}, provide a solution to this
problem of missing epidemiologic data.

Nonsampling variation that cannot be explained is another problem with
such noisy and heterogeneous data.  Chapters
\ref{theory-covariate_modeling} and \ref{applications-rfx} explain how
random effects can be used to detect systematic differences among
different hierarchies of data.

It is intuitive that there is a relationship between these
epidemiologic parameters: every prevalent case was once an incident
case, for example.  Combining all parameters to produce internally
consistent results is discussed in detail in Chapter
\ref{sys-dynamics}.  Through the process of data confrontation
discussed in the following chapters, the meta-analysis produces a best
estimate and uncertainty bounds of disease prevalence, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:intro-parkinsons fit}.

              disease in Western European females in 2005. TK
              self-contained description of contents of each panel:
              horizontal bar represents one row of data from
              systematic review.  Left and right endpoints represent
              age range of heterogeneous age groups, level represents
              level of parameter (e.g. prevalence).  Error bars are
              omitted, but each row of data includes a standard error
              or similar quantification of uncertainty as well.}
