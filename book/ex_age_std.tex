\section{Age-Standardizing Count (ASC) Models}

Age-standardizing models are a theoretically appealing way to combine
data from epidemiological studies with incommensurate age ranges for
the sample population. In one common application, the goal is to
combine information from a small study that reported on very fine age
intervals with information from a larger study that reported on more
granular age intervals.

Here is a real example from GBD2010, TK:
