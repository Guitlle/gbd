\chapter{Missing epidemiological parameter data: traumatic brain injury}
\label{applications-double_dismod}

The GDB 2010 Study uses prevalence for the measurement of disease burden.

For whatever reason, data are often not available for one or more
epidemiological parameters.  In the GBD 2010 study, this is
problematic when the missing parameter is needed for the calculation
of disease burden.  Injuries provide an excellent example of missing
epidemiological parameter data as incidence is often only reported.

Data only include cases warranting hospital care and cases warranting
treatment by health care professional but not hospitalization (other
health care).  As seen in Figure \ref{fig:app-injury brain fit},
only incidence data were available from hospital discharge records.

To estimate prevalence, incidence data are used in a compartmental model to estimate the
age-specific burden of traumatic brain injury, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:app-injury brain fit}.  By fitting all of the epidemiological
parameters together, the compartmental model can estimate prevalence
without prevalence data.  Without the compartmental model, TK another method.

However, traumatic brain injury have a wide range of
causes, ranging from unintentional falls to traffic injuries.  
Given some cases suffer acute injury while others sustain
chronic conditions, the burden of the disease and the mortality hazard
differ by cause.  Therefore the compartmental model must be modified 
for traumatic brain injury to avoid violating the model assumption of a
constant mortality hazard.  To address this disparity in mortality
risk, traumatic brain injury can be divided into short term and long term
causes.  This method is also necessary for other injuries and
diseases such as heart attack and stroke.

Focusing solely on long term traumatic brain injury, the compartmental model simultaneously fits all epidemiological parameters to estimate traumatic brain injury
prevalence, as see in Figure \ref{fig:app-injury brain fit}.  TK better 
description of what compartmental model did and how hard it would be any other way
