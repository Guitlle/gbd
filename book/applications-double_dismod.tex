So injuries…
know incidence and need prevalence…
more consistent models


For the 2010 GBD Study, injuries include all conditions that are codable to the ICD-9 and ICD-10 injuries chapter.  This example solely focuses on transport injuries.  Transport injuries include road injuries for pedestrian, bicyclist, motorized two-wheeler rider, occupation motorized vehicle with 3 or more wheels, and other road injury.  It also includes other transport injury and unintentional other transport injury.




Injury is a condition codable to the ICD-9 and ICD-10 chapters with that name
only cases warranting hospitalization and cases warranting treatment by health care professional but not hospitalization included
includes short term and long term outcomes yields total global burden of injury

Transport injuries include road injury for pedestrian, bicyclist, motorized two-wheeler rider, occupation motorized vehicle with 3 or more wheels, and other road injury.  It also includes other transport injury and unintentional other transport injury

modeled mortality rates from VA, surveillance systems, survey/census, police reports for mortality data


DisMod:
hospital records -> incidence data for cause of injury incidence
discharge databases -> proportion cases for nature of incidence -> incidence for nature of injury
all short-term incidence -> short-term prevalence by cause or injury
portion of long-term incidence -> nature of injury prevalence




Injury incidence includes injury warranting hospital admission and injury warranting other health care.  Only include a portion of incidence in calculation of prevalence.  Assumes no remission and uses relative-risk of mortality and standardized mortality ration from literature reviews.

As discussed in Chapter 1.5, epidemiologic parameters, such as incidence, prevalence, remission, and with-condition mortality, are related by a logical requirement of internal consistency.  A prevalent case can only exist if there was a past incidence event and the current number of prevalence cases can be determined from past prevalent cases, new incident cases, deaths and remissions.  Modeling the parameters simultaneously produces a best estimate and plausible uncertainty bounds for incidence and prevalence that are internally consistent estimates for a single time, place and sex.
