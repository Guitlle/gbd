=====================
Covariate Data Server
=====================

The Covariate Data Server will be similar to the Population Data
Server.  It stores and displays estimates of relevant covariates by
region (e.g. GDP by country and GBD region).

The covariate data server must:

1. import data from csv files developed by the IHME Common Indicators work group

2. serve the data to other dismod components, for example when
   importing dismod disease data


Current Implementation
----------------------

None yet.

Test Driven Development
-----------------------

There should be unit and functional tests to cover all the code in
this module.
