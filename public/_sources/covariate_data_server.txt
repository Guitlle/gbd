=====================
Covariate Data Server
=====================

The Covariate Data Server is similar to the Population Data Server,
but has no age-specific information.  It stores and displays estimates
of relevant covariates by country, year, and optionally sex (e.g. GDP or education).

The covariate data server must:

1. import data from csv files, with columns 'iso3', 'year', 'sex' (optional), and <covariate name>

2. serve the data to other dismod components, for example when
   importing dismod disease data


Current Implementation
----------------------

There are now some stub views and command-line tools.  To upload a new
country-level covariate, prepare a csv file for all country-years with
columns as listed above, and then use the url http://winthrop.ihme.washington.edu/covariate/upload

This view requires you input the name of the column containing the covariate of interest, for example if your table looks like this:

+------+------+------+
| iso3 | year | gdp  |
+------+------+------+
| USA  | 2005 | 1.30 |
+------+------+------+
| ...  | ...  | ...  |
+------+------+------+

The type should be `gdp`.


Test Driven Development
-----------------------

There should be unit and functional tests to cover all the code in
this module.
